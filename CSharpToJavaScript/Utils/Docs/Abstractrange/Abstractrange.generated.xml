<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> As an abstract interface, you will not directly instantiate an object of type <c>AbstractRange</c>. Instead, you will use the <see cref="Range"/> or <see cref="StaticRange"/> interfaces. To understand the difference between those two interfaces, and how to choose which is appropriate for your needs, consult each interface's documentation.</para></blockquote><para></para>
