<summary>
Used in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA live regions</see>, the global <c>aria-busy</c> state indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>When multiple parts of a live region need to be loaded before changes are announced to the user, set <c>aria-busy=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;</c> until loading is complete. Then set to <c>aria-busy=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;</c>. This prevents assistive technologies from announcing changes before updates are done.</para>
