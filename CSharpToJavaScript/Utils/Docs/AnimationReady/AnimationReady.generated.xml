<AnimationReady>
<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>Animation.ready</c></strong> property of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">Web Animations API</see> returns a <see cref="Promise"/> which resolves when the animation is ready to play. A new promise is created every time the animation enters the <c>&amp;quot;pending&amp;quot;</c> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Animation/playState">play state</see> as well as when the animation is canceled, since in both of those scenarios, the animation is ready to be started again.

<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Since the same <see cref="Promise"/> is used for both pending <c>play</c> and pending <c>pause</c> requests, authors are advised to check the state of the animation when the promise is resolved.</para></blockquote>
