<remarks>
<para>This is relevant to user agents that by default block access to unpartitioned cookies by sites loaded in a third-party context to improve privacy (e.g. to prevent tracking), and is part of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">Storage Access API</see>.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Usage of this feature may be blocked by a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/storage-access">Permissions-Policy/storage-access</see> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy">Permissions Policy</see> set on your server.

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> that fulfills with <c>undefined</c> if the access to unpartitioned cookies was granted, and rejects if access was denied.<c>requestStorageAccess()</c> requests are automatically denied unless the embedded content is currently processing a user gesture such as a tap or click (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/transient activation">transient activation</see>), or unless permission was already granted previously. If permission was not previously granted, they need to be run inside a user gesture-based event handler. The user gesture behavior depends on the state of the promise:</returns>
