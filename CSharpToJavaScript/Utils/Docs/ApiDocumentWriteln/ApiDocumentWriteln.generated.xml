<para>As <see href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#document.write()">the HTML spec itself warns</see>:</para><blockquote><para>This method has very idiosyncratic behavior. In some cases, this method can affect the state of the <see href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#html-parser">HTML parser</see> while the parser is running, resulting in a DOM that does not correspond to the source of the document (e.g. if the string written is the string &amp;quot;<c>&amp;lt;plaintext&amp;gt;</c>&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;<c>&amp;lt;!--</c>&amp;quot;). In other cases, the call can clear the current page first, as if <see href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#dom-document-open"><c>document.open()</c></see> had been called. In yet more cases, the method is simply ignored, or throws an exception. Users agents are <see href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#document-written-scripts-intervention">explicitly allowed to avoid executing <c>script</c> elements inserted via this method</see>. And to make matters even worse, the exact behavior of this method can in some cases be dependent on network latency, which can lead to failures that are very hard to debug. For all these reasons, use of this method is strongly discouraged.<br/>Therefore, avoid using <c>document.writeln()</c> â€” and if possible, update any existing code that is still using it.</para></blockquote><para>Writes a string of text followed by a newline character to a document.</para>
