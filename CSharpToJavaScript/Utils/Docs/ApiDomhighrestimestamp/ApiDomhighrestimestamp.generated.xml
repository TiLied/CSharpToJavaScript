<DOMHighResTimeStamp>
<summary>
The <strong><c>DOMHighResTimeStamp</c></strong> type is a <c>double</c> and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This type can be used to describe a discrete point in time or a time interval (the difference in time between two discrete points in time). The starting time can be either a specific time determined by the script for a site or app, or the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin">time origin</see>.</para><para>The time, given in milliseconds, should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds), with the fractional part of the number indicating fractions of a millisecond. However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 µs (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond. Also note the section below on reduced time precision controlled by browser preferences to avoid timing attacks and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fingerprinting">fingerprinting</see>.</para><para>Further, if the device or operating system the user agent is running on doesn&amp;apos;t have a clock accurate to the microsecond level, they may only be accurate to the millisecond.</para>
