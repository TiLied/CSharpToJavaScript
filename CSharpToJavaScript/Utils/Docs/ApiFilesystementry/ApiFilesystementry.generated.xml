<FileSystemEntry>
<summary>
The <strong><c>FileSystemEntry</c></strong> interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a single entry in a file system. The entry can be a file or a directory (directories are represented by the <see cref="FileSystemDirectoryEntry."/> interface). It includes methods for working with files—including copying, moving, removing, and reading files—as well as information about a file it points to—including the file name and its path from the root to the entry.
