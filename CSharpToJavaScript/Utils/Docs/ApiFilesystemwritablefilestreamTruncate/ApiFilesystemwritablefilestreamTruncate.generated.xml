</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the size specified is larger than the current file size the file is padded with <c>0x00</c> bytes.</para><para>The file cursor is also updated when <c>truncate()</c> is called.<br/>If the offset is smaller than the size, it remains unchanged.<br/>If the offset is larger than size, the offset is set to that size.<br/>This ensures that subsequent writes do not error.</para><para>No changes are written to the actual file on disk until the stream has been closed.<br/>Changes are typically written to a temporary file instead.</para>
