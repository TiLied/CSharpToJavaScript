<para>An intervention report is generated when usage of a feature in a web document has been blocked by the browser for reasons such as security, performance, or user annoyance. So for example, a script was been stopped because it was significantly slowing down the browser, or the browser&amp;apos;s autoplay policy blocked audio from playing without a user gesture to trigger it.</para><para>A deprecation report is generated when a deprecated feature (for example a deprecated API method) is used on a document being observed by a <see cref="ReportingObserver."/>. In addition to the support of this API, receiving useful intervention warnings relies on browser vendors adding these warnings for the relevant features.</para><para></para>
