<summary>
The <strong><c>MouseEvent.button</c></strong> read-only property indicates which button was pressed on the mouse to trigger the event.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This property only guarantees to indicate which buttons are pressed during events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple buttons.<br/>As such, it is not reliable for events such as <see cref="Element/mouseenter_event."/>, <see cref="Element/mouseleave_event."/>, <see cref="Element/mouseover_event."/>, <see cref="Element/mouseout_event."/>, or <see cref="Element/mousemove_event."/>.</para><para>Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device so that if an event&amp;apos;s button property is zero, it may not have been caused by the button that is physically left–most on the pointing device; however, it should behave as if the left button was clicked in the standard button layout.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Do not confuse this property with the <see cref="MouseEvent.Buttons."/> property, which indicates which buttons are pressed for all mouse events types.</para></blockquote>

<value>A number representing a given button:As noted above, buttons may be configured differently to the standard &amp;quot;left to right&amp;quot; layout.<br/>A mouse configured for left-handed use may have the button actions reversed.<br/>Some pointing devices only have one button and use keyboard or other input mechanisms to indicate main, secondary, auxiliary, etc.<br/>Others may have many buttons mapped to different functions and button values.</value>
