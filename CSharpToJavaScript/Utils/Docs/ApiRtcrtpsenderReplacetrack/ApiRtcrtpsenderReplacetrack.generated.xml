<para>The new<br/>track must be of the same media kind (audio, video, etc.) and switching the track should<br/>not require negotiation.</para><para>Among the use cases for <c>replaceTrack()</c> is the common need to switch<br/>between the rear- and front-facing cameras on a phone. With <c>replaceTrack()</c>,<br/>you can have a track object for each camera and switch between the two as needed. See<br/>the example <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#switching_cameras">Switching cameras</see> below.</para>

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the track has been successfully<br/>replaced. The promise is rejected if the track cannot be replaced for any reason; this<br/>is commonly because the change would require renegotiation of the codec, which is not<br/>allowed (see <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#things_that_require_negotiation">Things that require negotiation</see>).If <c>newTrack</c> was omitted or was <c>null</c>,<br/><c>replaceTrack()</c> stops the sender. No negotiation is required in this case.When the promise is fulfilled, the fulfillment handler receives a value of<br/><c>undefined</c>.</returns>
