<ServiceWorkerContainerReady>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ready</c></strong> read-only property of<br/>the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer."/> interface provides a way of delaying code<br/>execution until a service worker is active. It returns a <see cref="Promise"/> that<br/>will never reject, and which waits indefinitely until<br/>the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration."/> associated with the current page has<br/>an <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Active."/> worker. Once that<br/>condition is met, it resolves with<br/>the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration."/>.
