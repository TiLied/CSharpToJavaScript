<value>A float representing the rate value.<br/>It can range between 0.1 (lowest) and 10 (highest), with 1 being the default rate for the current platform or voice, which should correspond to a normal speaking rate.<br/>Other values act as a percentage relative to this, so for example 2 is twice as fast, 0.5 is half as fast, etc.Some speech synthesis engines or voices may constrain the minimum and maximum rates further.<br/>If <see href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">SSML</see> is used, this value will be overridden by <see href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.2.4">prosody tags</see> in the markup.</value>
