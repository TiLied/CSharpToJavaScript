<TouchRadiusX>
<summary>
The <strong><c>radiusX</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="Touch."/> interface returns the X radius of the ellipse that most closely circumscribes the area of contact with the touch surface. The value is in CSS pixels of the same scale as <see cref="Touch.ScreenX."/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This value, in combination with <see cref="Touch.RadiusY."/> and <see cref="Touch.RotationAngle."/> constructs an ellipse that approximates the size and shape of the area of contact between the user and the screen. This may be a relatively large ellipse representing the contact between a fingertip and the screen or a small area representing the tip of a stylus, for example.</para>
