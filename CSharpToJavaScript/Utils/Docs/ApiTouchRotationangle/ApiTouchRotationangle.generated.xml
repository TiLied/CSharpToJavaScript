<TouchRotationAngle>
<summary>
The <strong><c>rotationAngle</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="Touch."/> interface returns the rotation angle, in degrees, of the contact area ellipse defined by <see cref="Touch.RadiusX."/> and <see cref="Touch.RadiusY."/>. The value may be between 0 and 90. Together, these three values describe an ellipse that approximates the size and shape of the area of contact between the user and the screen. This may be a relatively large ellipse representing the contact between a fingertip and the screen or a small area representing the tip of a stylus, for example.
