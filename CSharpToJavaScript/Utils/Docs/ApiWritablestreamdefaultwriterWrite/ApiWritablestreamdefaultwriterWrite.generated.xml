<WritableStreamDefaultWriterWrite>
<summary>
The <strong><c>write()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter."/> interface writes a passed chunk of data to a<br/><see cref="WritableStream."/> and its underlying sink, then returns a<br/><see cref="Promise"/> that resolves to indicate the success or failure of the write<br/>operation.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Note that what &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; means is up to the underlying sink; it might indicate that the<br/>chunk has been accepted, and not necessarily that it is safely saved to its ultimate<br/>destination.</para>
