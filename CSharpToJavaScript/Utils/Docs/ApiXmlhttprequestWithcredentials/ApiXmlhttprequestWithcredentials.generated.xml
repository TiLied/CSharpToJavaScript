<XMLHttpRequestWithCredentials>
<summary>
The <strong><c>XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials</c></strong> property is a boolean value that indicates whether or not cross-site <c>Access-Control</c> requests should be made using credentials such as cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates. Setting <c>withCredentials</c> has no effect on same-origin requests.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>In addition, this flag is also used to indicate when cookies are to be ignored in the response. The default is <c>false</c>. <c>XMLHttpRequest</c> responses from a different domain cannot set cookie values for their own domain unless <c>withCredentials</c> is set to <c>true</c> before making the request. The third-party cookies obtained by setting <c>withCredentials</c> to true will still honor same-origin policy and hence can not be accessed by the requesting script through <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie">document.cookie</see> or from response headers.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> This never affects same-origin requests.</para></blockquote><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <c>XMLHttpRequest</c> responses from a different domain <strong>cannot</strong> set cookie values for their own domain unless <c>withCredentials</c> is set to <c>true</c> before making the request, regardless of <c>Access-Control-</c> header values.</para></blockquote>
