<summary>
The <strong><c>fixedFoveation</c></strong> property of the <see cref="XRProjectionLayer."/> interface is a number indicating the amount of foveation used by the XR compositor for the layer. Fixed Foveated Rendering (FFR) renders the edges of the eye textures at a lower resolution than the center and reduces the GPU load.

<remarks>
<para>It is most useful for low-contrast textures such as background images, but less for high-contrast ones such as text or detailed images. Authors can adjust the level on a per-frame basis to achieve the best tradeoff between performance and visual quality.</para>

<value>A number between 0 and 1.It's up to the user agent how to interpret the numbers in this range. When changing the foveation level, the effect will visible in the next <see cref="XRFrame."/>.Note that some user agents might implement certain levels of foveation, so you might need to adjust the foveation level in large increments to see an effect. Example levels:Some devices don&amp;apos;t support foveated rendering.
