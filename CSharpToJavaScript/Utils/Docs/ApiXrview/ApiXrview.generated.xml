<XRView>
<summary>
The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR Device API</see>&amp;apos;s <strong><c>XRView</c></strong> interface describes a single view into the XR scene for a specific frame, providing orientation and position information for the viewpoint. You can think of it as a description of a specific eye or camera and how it views the world. A 3D frame will involve two views, one for each eye, separated by an appropriate distance which approximates the distance between the viewer&amp;apos;s eyes. This allows the two views, when projected in isolation into the appropriate eyes, to simulate a 3D world.
