<AudioBufferSourceNode>
<summary>
The <strong><c>AudioBufferSourceNode</c></strong> interface is an <see cref="AudioScheduledSourceNode"/> which represents an audio source consisting of in-memory audio data, stored in an <see cref="AudioBuffer"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This interface is especially useful for playing back audio which has particularly stringent timing accuracy requirements, such as for sounds that must match a specific rhythm and can be kept in memory rather than being played from disk or the network. To play sounds which require accurate timing but must be streamed from the network or played from disk, use a <see cref="AudioWorkletNode"/> to implement its playback.</para><para></para><para>An <c>AudioBufferSourceNode</c> has no inputs and exactly one output, which has the same number of channels as the <c>AudioBuffer</c> indicated by its <see cref="AudioBufferSourceNode.Buffer"/> property. If there's no buffer set—that is, if <c>buffer</c> is <c>null</c>—the output contains a single channel of silence (every sample is 0).</para><para>An <c>AudioBufferSourceNode</c> can only be played once; after each call to <see cref="AudioScheduledSourceNode.Start"/>, you have to create a new node if you want to play the same sound again. Fortunately, these nodes are very inexpensive to create, and the actual <c>AudioBuffer</c>s can be reused for multiple plays of the sound. Indeed, you can use these nodes in a &amp;quot;fire and forget&amp;quot; manner: create the node, call <c>start()</c> to begin playing the sound, and don&amp;apos;t even bother to hold a reference to it. It will automatically be garbage-collected at an appropriate time, which won&amp;apos;t be until sometime after the sound has finished playing.</para><para>Multiple calls to <see cref="AudioScheduledSourceNode/stop"/> are allowed. The most recent call replaces the previous one, if the <c>AudioBufferSourceNode</c> has not already reached the end of the buffer.</para><para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orgwebaudioaudiobuffersourcenode.png">The AudioBufferSourceNode takes the content of an AudioBuffer and m</see></para>
