<AudioContextClose>
<summary>
The <c>close()</c> method of the <see cref="AudioContext"/> Interface closes the audio context, releasing any system audio resources that it uses.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This function does not automatically release all <c>AudioContext</c>-created objects, unless other references have been released as well; however, it will forcibly release any system audio resources that might prevent additional <c>AudioContexts</c> from being created and used, suspend the progression of audio time in the audio context, and stop processing audio data. The returned <see cref="Promise"/> resolves when all <c>AudioContext</c>-creation-blocking resources have been released. This method throws an <c>INVALID_STATE_ERR</c> exception if called on an <see cref="OfflineAudioContext"/>.</para>
