The <strong><c>attestationObject</c></strong> property of the<br/><see cref="AuthenticatorAttestationResponse"/> interface returns an<br/><see cref="ArrayBuffer"/> containing the new public key, as well as signature over the<br/>entire <c>attestationObject</c> with a private key that is stored in the<br/>authenticator when it is manufactured.

The public key<br/>that corresponds to the private key that has created the attestation signature is well<br/>known; however, there are various well known attestation public key chains for different<br/>ecosystems (for example, Android or TPM attestations).</para>
<para>-<see cref="CredentialsContainer.Create"/>: the method used to create a statement with<br/>a cryptographic <c>challenge</c> which signature by the authenticator is contained in <c>attStmt</c>,<br/>with the specified <c>attestation</c> transport option.<br/></para>
