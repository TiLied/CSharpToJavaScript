<Badging_API>
<summary>
The <strong>Badging API</strong> gives web developers a method of setting a badge on a document or application, to act as a notification that state has changed without displaying a more distracting notification. A common use case for this would be an application with a messaging feature displaying a badge on the app icon to show that new messages have arrived.
