<Battery_Status_API>
<summary>
The <strong>Battery Status API</strong>, more often referred to as the <strong>Battery API</strong>, provides information about the system&amp;apos;s battery charge level and lets you be notified by events that are sent when the battery level or charging status change. This can be used to adjust your app&amp;apos;s resource usage to reduce battery drain when the battery is low, or to save changes before the battery runs out in order to prevent data loss.
