<summary>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> The <strong><c>getAvailability()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Bluetooth"/> interface <strong>nominally</strong> returns <c>true</c> if the user agent can support Bluetooth (because the device has a Bluetooth adapter), and <c>false</c> otherwise.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The word &amp;quot;nominally&amp;quot; is used because if permission to use the Web Bluetooth API is disallowed by the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/bluetooth"><c>Permissions-Policy: bluetooth</c></see> permission, the method will always return <c>false</c>.<br/>In addition, a user can configure their browser to return <c>false</c> from a <c>getAvailability()</c> call even if the browser does have an operational Bluetooth adapter, and vice versa. This setting value ignored if access is blocked by the permission.</para><para>Even if <c>getAvailability()</c> returns <c>true</c> and the device actually has a Bluetooth adaptor, this does not necessarily mean that calling <see cref="Bluetooth.RequestDevice"/> will resolve with a <see cref="BluetoothDevice"/>.<br/>The Bluetooth adapter may not be powered, and a user might deny permission to use the API when prompted.</para>

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> that resolves with a <see cref="Boolean"/>.The <see cref="Promise"/> will resolve with a value of <c>false</c> if access is disallowed by <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/bluetooth"><c>Permissions-Policy: bluetooth</c></see>, if the user has configured the browser to always resolve with <c>false</c>, or if the device does not have a Bluetooth adapter.<br/>Otherwise it will resolve with <c>true</c>.</returns>
