<para>AvailableInWorkers</para><para>By creating a <see cref="BroadcastChannel"/> object, you can receive any messages that are posted to it. You don't have to maintain a reference to the frames or workers you wish to communicate with: they can "subscribe" to a particular channel by constructing their own <see cref="BroadcastChannel"/> with the same name, and have bi-directional communication between all of them.</para><para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orgbroadcastchannel.png">The principle of the Broadcast Channel API</see></para>
