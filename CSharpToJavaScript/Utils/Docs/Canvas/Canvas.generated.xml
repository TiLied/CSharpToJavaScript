Until now we have created our own <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes">shapes</see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors">applied styles</see> to them. One of the more exciting features of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">canvas</see> is the ability to use images. These can be used to do dynamic photo compositing or as backdrops of graphs, for sprites in games, and so forth. External images can be used in any format supported by the browser, such as PNG, GIF, or JPEG. You can even use the image produced by other canvas elements on the same page as the source!
