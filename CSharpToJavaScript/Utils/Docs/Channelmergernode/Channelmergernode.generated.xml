<ChannelMergerNode>
<summary>
The <c>ChannelMergerNode</c> interface, often used in conjunction with its opposite, <see cref="ChannelSplitterNode"/>, reunites different mono inputs into a single output. Each input is used to fill a channel of the output. This is useful for accessing each channels separately, e.g. for performing channel mixing where gain must be separately controlled on each channel.

In that case, when the signal is sent to the <see cref="BaseAudioContext/listener"/> object, supernumerary channels will be ignored.</para><para></para>
