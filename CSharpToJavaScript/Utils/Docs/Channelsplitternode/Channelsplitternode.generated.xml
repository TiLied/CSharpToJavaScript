<ChannelSplitterNode>
<summary>
The <c>ChannelSplitterNode</c> interface, often used in conjunction with its opposite, <see cref="ChannelMergerNode."/>, separates the different channels of an audio source into a set of mono outputs. This is useful for accessing each channel separately, e.g. for performing channel mixing where gain must be separately controlled on each channel.

In the case that no value is given, it will default to <c>6</c>. If there are fewer channels in the input than there are outputs, supernumerary outputs are silent.</para><para></para>
