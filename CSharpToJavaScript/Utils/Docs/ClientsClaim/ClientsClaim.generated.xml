<ClientsClaim>
<summary>
The <strong><c>claim()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Clients"/> interface allows an active service worker to set itself as the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer.Controller"/> for all clients within its <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Scope"/>.<br/>This triggers a &amp;quot;<c>controllerchange</c>" event on <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> in any clients that become controlled by this service worker.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>When a service worker is initially registered, pages won&amp;apos;t use it until they next<br/>load. The <c>claim()</c> method causes those pages to be controlled immediately.<br/>Be aware that this results in your service worker controlling pages that loaded<br/>regularly over the network, or possibly via a different service worker.</para>
