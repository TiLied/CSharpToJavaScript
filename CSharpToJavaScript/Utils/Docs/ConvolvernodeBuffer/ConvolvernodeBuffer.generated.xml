<ConvolverNodeBuffer>
<summary>
The <strong><c>buffer</c></strong> property of the <see cref="ConvolverNode"/> interface represents a mono, stereo, or 4-channel <see cref="AudioBuffer"/> containing the (possibly multichannel) impulse response used by the <c>ConvolverNode</c> to create the reverb effect.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is normally a simple recording of as-close-to-an-impulse as can be found in the space you want to model. For example, if you want to model the reverb in your bathroom, you might set up a microphone near the door to record the sound of a balloon pop or synthesized impulse from the sink. That audio recording could then be used as the buffer.</para><para>This <strong><see cref="AudioBuffer"/></strong> must have the same sample-rate as the <c>AudioContext</c> or an exception will be thrown. At the time when this attribute is set, the buffer and the state of the attribute will be used to configure the <c>ConvolverNode</c> with this impulse response having the given normalization. The initial value of this attribute is <c>null</c>.</para>
