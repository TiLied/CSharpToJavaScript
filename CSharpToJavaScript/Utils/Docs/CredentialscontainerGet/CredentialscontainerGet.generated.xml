<CredentialsContainerGet>
<summary>
The <strong><c>get()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="CredentialsContainer."/> interface returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fulfills with a single credential instance that matches the provided parameters, which the browser can then use to authenticate with a relying party. This is used by several different credential-related APIs with significantly different purposes:

<remarks>
<para>The below reference page starts with a syntax section that explains the general method call structure and parameters that apply to all the different APIs. After that, it is split into separate sections providing parameters, return values, and examples specific to each API.</para>

<returns>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a <see cref="Credential."/> instance matching the provided parameters:If a single credential cannot be unambiguously obtained, the Promise will resolve to <c>null</c>.A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with an <see cref="IdentityCredential."/> instance matching the provided parameters if the user identity is successfully validated by the IdP.This object contains a token that includes user identity information that has been signed with the IdP's <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/digital certificate">digital certificate</see>.The RP sends the token to its server to validate the certificate, and on success can use the (now trusted) identity information in the token to sign them into their service (starting a new session), sign them up to their service if they are a new user, etc.If the <c>get()</c> method&amp;apos;s promise rejects, the RP can direct the user to the IdP login page to sign in or create an account.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The exact nature of the token is opaque to the FedCM API, and to the browser. The IdP decides on the syntax and usage of it, and the RP needs to follow the instructions provided by the IdP (see <see href="https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/verify-google-id-token">Verify the Google ID token on your server side</see>, for example) to make sure they are using it correctly.</blockquote>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with an <see cref="OTPCredential."/> object instance.A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with an <see cref="PublicKeyCredential."/> instance matching the provided parameters. If a single credential cannot be unambiguously obtained, the Promise will resolve to <c>null</c>.</returns>
