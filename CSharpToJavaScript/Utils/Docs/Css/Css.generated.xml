<summary>
<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (<strong>CSS</strong>) is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet">stylesheet</see> language used to describe the presentation of a document written in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</see> or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction">XML</see> (including XML dialects such as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML">MathML</see> or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML">XHTML</see>). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

<remarks>
<para>CSS is among the core languages of the <strong>open web</strong> and is standardized across Web browsers according to <see href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs">W3C specifications</see>. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</para><para>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to <see href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">develop and release recommendations separately per module</see>. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of <see href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css/">the latest stable state of the CSS specification</see> and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as <see href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/">CSS Color Module Level 5</see>.</para>
