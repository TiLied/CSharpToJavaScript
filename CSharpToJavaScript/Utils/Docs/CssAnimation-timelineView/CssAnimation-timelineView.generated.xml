<summary>
The <strong><c>view()</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions">CSS function</see> can be used with <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline">animation-timeline</see> to indicate a subject element that will provide an anonymous view progress timeline to animate. The view progress timeline is progressed through by a change in visibility of the subject element inside the nearest ancestor scroller. The visibility of the subject inside the scroller is tracked â€” by default, the timeline is at 0% when the subject is first visible at one edge of the scroller, and 100% when it reaches the opposite edge.
