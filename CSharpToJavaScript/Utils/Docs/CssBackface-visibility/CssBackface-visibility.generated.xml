<para>EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/backface-visibility.html")</para><para>An element&amp;apos;s back face is a mirror image of its front face. Though invisible in 2D, the back face can become visible when a transformation causes the element to be rotated in 3D space. (This property has no effect on 2D transforms, which have no perspective.)</para>
