<CSSContent-visibility>
<summary>
The <strong><c>content-visibility</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see> property controls whether or not an element renders its contents at all, along with forcing a strong set of containments, allowing user agents to potentially omit large swathes of layout and rendering work until it becomes needed. It enables the user agent to skip an element&amp;apos;s rendering work (including layout and painting) until it is needed â€” which makes the initial page load much faster.

<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> The <see cref="Element/contentvisibilityautostatechange_event."/> event fires on any element with <c>content-visibility: auto</c> set on it when its rendering work starts or stops being skipped. This provides a convenient way for an app's code to start or stop rendering processes (e.g. drawing on a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">canvas</see>) when they are not needed, thereby conserving processing power.</para></blockquote>
