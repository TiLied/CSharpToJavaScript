The browser will select the first font in the list that is installed or that can be downloaded using a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face">@font-face</see> at-rule.</para><para>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font">font</see> to set <c>font-size</c> and other font related properties all at once.</para><para>You should always include at least one generic family name in a <c>font-family</c> list, since there&amp;apos;s no guarantee that any given font is available. This lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when necessary.</para><para>The <c>font-family</c> property specifies a list of fonts, from highest priority to lowest. Font selection <strong>does not</strong> stop at the first font in the list that is on the user&amp;apos;s system. Rather, font selection is done <strong>one character at a time</strong>, so that if an available font does not have a glyph for a needed character, the latter fonts are tried. When a font is only available in some <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style">styles</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant">variants</see>, or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">sizes</see>, those properties may also influence which font family is chosen.</para>
