<remarks>
<para>Resolution and bandwidth differ by device and network access. The <c>image-set()</c> function delivers the most appropriate image resolution for a user&amp;apos;s device, providing a set of image options — each with an associated resolution declaration — from which the browser picks the most appropriate for the device and settings. Resolution can be used as a proxy for filesize — a user agent on a slow mobile connection with a high-resolution screen may prefer to receive lower-resolution images rather than waiting for a higher resolution image to load.</para><para><c>image-set()</c> allows the author to provide options rather than determining what each individual user needs.</para>
