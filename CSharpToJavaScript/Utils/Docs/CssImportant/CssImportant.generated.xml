The <c>!important</c> flag alters the rules selecting declarations inside the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade">cascade</see>. A declaration that is not <strong>important</strong> is called <strong>normal</strong>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>To mark a declaration important, add the <strong>important flag</strong> (<c>!important</c>) after the value in the declaration. While white space is allowed between the delimiter and the keyword, the flag is generally written as <c>!important</c> without any white space.</para><para>The <c>!important</c> comes after the value of the property value pair declaration, preceded by at least one space. The important flag must be the last token in the declaration. In other words, there can be white space and comments between the flag and the declaration&amp;apos;s ending semicolon, but nothing else.</para>
