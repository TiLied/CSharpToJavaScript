<summary>
The <strong><c>mask-size</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see> property specifies the sizes of the mask images. The size of the image can be fully or partially constrained in order to preserve its intrinsic ratio.

<value>The interpretation of possible values depends on the image&amp;apos;s intrinsic dimensions (width and height) and intrinsic proportion (ratio of width and height). A bitmap image always has intrinsic dimensions and an intrinsic proportion. A vector image may have both intrinsic dimensions and thus it has an intrinsic proportion too. It also may have one or no intrinsic dimensions and in either case it might or might not have an intrinsic proportion. Gradients are treated as images with no intrinsic dimensions or intrinsic proportion.The rendered size of the mask image is then computed as follows:</value>
