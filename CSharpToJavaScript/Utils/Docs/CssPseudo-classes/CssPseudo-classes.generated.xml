<summary>
A <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see> <strong><strong>pseudo-class</strong></strong> is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover">:hover</see> can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.

<remarks>
<para>A pseudo-class consists of a colon (<c>:</c>) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., <c>:hover</c>). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments (e.g., <c>:dir()</c>). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an <strong>anchor element</strong> (e.g., <c>button</c> in case <c>button:hover</c>).</para><para>Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited">:visited</see>, for example), the status of its content (like <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked">:checked</see> on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover">:hover</see>, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> In contrast to pseudo-classes, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements">pseudo-elements</see> can be used to style a <strong>specific part</strong> of an element.</para></blockquote>
