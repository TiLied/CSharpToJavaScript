<summary>
The <strong><c>revert</c></strong> CSS keyword reverts the cascaded value of the property from its current value to the value the property would have had if no changes had been made by the current <strong><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/style origin">style origin</see></strong> to the current element. Thus, it resets the property either to user agent set value, to user set value, to its inherited value (if it is inheritable), or to initial value. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">all</see>.

<remarks>
<para>This keyword removes from the cascade all of the styles that have been overridden until the style being rolled back to is reached.</para><para>The <c>revert</c> keyword works exactly the same as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unset"><c>unset</c></see> in many cases. The only difference is for properties that have values set by the browser or by custom stylesheets created by users (set on the browser side).</para><para>Revert will not affect rules applied to children of an element you reset (but will remove effects of a parent rule on a child). So if you have a <c>color: green</c> for all sections and <c>all: revert</c> on a specific section, the color of the section will be black. But if you have a rule to make all paragraphs red, then all paragraphs will still be red in all sections.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Revert is just a value. It is still possible to override the <c>revert</c> value using <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">specificity</see>.</para></blockquote><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> The <c>revert</c> keyword is different from and should not be confused with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial">initial</see> keyword, which uses the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value">initial value</see> defined on a per-property basis by the CSS specifications. In contrast, user-agent stylesheets set default values on the basis of CSS selectors.</para><para>For example, the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value">initial value</see> for the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#formal_definition"><c>display</c></see> property is <c>inline</c>, whereas a normal user-agent stylesheet sets the default {{cssxref("display")}} value of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">div</see>s to <c>block</c>, of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table">table</see>s to <c>table</c>, etc.</para></blockquote>
<para>-Use the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial">initial</see> keyword to set a property to its initial value.<br/>-Use the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit">inherit</see> keyword to make an element's property the same as its parent.<br/>-Use the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert-layer">revert-layer</see> keyword to reset a property to the value established in a previous cascade layer.<br/>-Use the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unset">unset</see> keyword to set a property to its inherited value if it inherits or to its initial value if not.<br/>-The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">all</see> property lets you reset all properties to their initial, inherited, reverted, or unset state at once.<br/></para>
