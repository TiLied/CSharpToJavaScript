</summary>
<remarks>
<para>By default, a named timeline (i.e. declared using <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-timeline-name">scroll-timeline-name</see> or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-timeline-name">view-timeline-name</see>) can only be set as the controlling timeline of a direct descendant element (i.e. by setting <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline">animation-timeline</see> on it with the timeline name as its value). This is the timeline's default "scope".</para><para><c>timeline-scope</c> is given the name of a timeline defined on a descendant element; this causes the scope of the timeline to be increased to the element that <c>timeline-scope</c> is set on and any of its descendants. In other words, that element and any of its descendant elements can now be controlled using that timeline.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> If no timeline (or more than one timeline) exists with the name given for the <c>timeline-scope</c> value, an inactive timeline with the specified name is created.</para></blockquote>
