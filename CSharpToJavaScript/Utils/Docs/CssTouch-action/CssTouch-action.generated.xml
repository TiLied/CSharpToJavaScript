<summary>
The <strong><c>touch-action</c></strong> CSS property sets how an element&amp;apos;s region can be manipulated by a touchscreen user (for example, by zooming features built into the browser).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>By default, panning (scrolling) and pinching gestures are handled exclusively by the browser. An application using {{domxref(&amp;quot;Pointer_events&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pointer events&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, 1)}} will receive a <see cref="Element/pointercancel_event."/> event when the browser starts handling a touch gesture. By explicitly specifying which gestures should be handled by the browser, an application can supply its own behavior in <see cref="Element/pointermove_event."/> and <see cref="Element/pointerup_event."/> listeners for the remaining gestures. Applications using {{domxref("Touch_events", "Touch events", &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, 1)}} disable the browser handling of gestures by calling <see cref="Event.PreventDefault."/>, but should also use <c>touch-action</c> to ensure the browser knows the intent of the application before any event listeners have been invoked.</para><para>When a gesture is started, the browser intersects the <c>touch-action</c> values of the touched element and its ancestors, up to the one that implements the gesture (in other words, the first containing scrolling element). This means that in practice, <c>touch-action</c> is typically applied only to top-level elements which have some custom behavior, without needing to specify <c>touch-action</c> explicitly on any of that element&amp;apos;s descendants.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> After a gesture starts, changes to <c>touch-action</c> will not have any impact on the behavior of the current gesture.</para></blockquote>
