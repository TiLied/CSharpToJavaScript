<summary>
The <strong><c>view-timeline-inset</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see> property is used to specify one or two values representing an adjustment to the position of the scrollport (see <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll container">Scroll container</see> for more details) in which the subject element of a <strong>named view progress timeline</strong> animation is deemed to be visible. Put another way, this allows you to specify start and/or end inset (or outset) values that offset the position of the timeline.
