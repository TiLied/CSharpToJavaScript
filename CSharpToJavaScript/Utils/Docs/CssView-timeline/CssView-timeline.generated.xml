The <strong><c>view-timeline</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties">shorthand property</see> is used to define a <strong>named view progress timeline</strong>, which is progressed through based on the change in visibility of an element (known as the <strong>subject</strong>) inside a scrollable element (<strong>scroller</strong>). <c>view-timeline</c> is set on the subject.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The visibility of the subject inside the scroller is tracked — by default, the timeline is at 0% when the subject is first visible at one edge of the scroller and 100% when it reaches the opposite edge.</para><para><c>view-timeline</c> can contain two constituent values — a name for the named view progress timeline and an optional scroll axis value.<br/>The name is then referenced in an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline"><c>animation-timeline</c></see> declaration to indicate the element that will be animated as the timeline progresses. This can be the subject element, but it doesn&amp;apos;t have to be — you can animate a different element as the subject moves through the scrolling area.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> If the scroller does not overflow its container in the axis dimension or if the overflow is hidden or clipped, no timeline will be created.</para></blockquote>
