<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>This interface was part of an attempt to create a typed CSS Object Model. This attempt has been abandoned, and most browsers do<br/>not implement it.</para><para>To achieve your purpose, you can use:</para></blockquote><para>This interface represents a single CSS value. It may be used to determine the value of a specific style property currently set in a block or to set a specific style property explicitly within the block. An instance of this interface might be obtained from the <see cref="CSSStyleDeclaration.GetPropertyCSSValue"/> method of the <see cref="CSSStyleDeclaration"/> interface. A <c>CSSPrimitiveValue</c> object only occurs in a context of a CSS property.</para><para>Conversions are allowed between absolute values (from millimeters to centimeters, from degrees to radians, and so on) but not between relative values. (For example, a pixel value cannot be converted to a centimeter value.) Percentage values can't be converted since they are relative to the parent value (or another property value). There is one exception for color percentage values: since a color percentage value is relative to the range 0-255, a color percentage value can be converted to a number (see also the <see cref="RGBColor"/> interface).</para><para></para>
