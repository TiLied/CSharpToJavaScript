<remarks>
<para><c>DataTransfer</c> was primarily designed for the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">HTML Drag and Drop API</see>, as the <see cref="DragEvent.DataTransfer"/> property, and is still specified in the HTML drag-and-drop section, but it is now also used by other APIs, such as <see cref="ClipboardEvent.ClipboardData"/> and <see cref="InputEvent.DataTransfer"/>. However, other APIs only use certain parts of its interface, ignoring properties such as <c>dropEffect</c>. Documentation of <c>DataTransfer</c> will primarily discuss its usage in drag-and-drop operations, and you should refer to the other APIs&amp;apos; documentation for usage of <c>DataTransfer</c> in those contexts.</para>
