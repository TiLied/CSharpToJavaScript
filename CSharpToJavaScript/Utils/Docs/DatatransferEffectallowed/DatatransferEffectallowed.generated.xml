<DataTransferEffectAllowed>
<summary>
The <strong><c>DataTransfer.effectAllowed</c></strong> property specifies the<br/>effect that is allowed for a drag operation. The <strong>copy</strong> operation is used to<br/>indicate that the data being dragged will be copied from its present location to the<br/>drop location. The <strong>move</strong> operation is used to indicate that the data being<br/>dragged will be moved, and the <strong>link</strong> operation is used to indicate that some<br/>form of relationship or connection will be created between the source and drop<br/>locations.

<remarks>
