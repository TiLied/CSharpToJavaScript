<DeviceMotionEventAccelerationIncludingGravity>
<summary>
The <strong><c>accelerationIncludingGravity</c></strong> property returns the<br/>amount of acceleration recorded by the device, in <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second_squared">meters per second squared (m/sÂ²)</see>. Unlike <see cref="DeviceMotionEvent.Acceleration"/><br/>which compensates for the influence of gravity, its value is the sum of the acceleration<br/>of the device as induced by the user and an acceleration equal and opposite to that<br/>caused by gravity. In other words, it measures the<br/><see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Force">g-force</see>. In practice, this value represents<br/>the raw data measured by an <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">accelerometer</see>.

<remarks>
<para>This value is not typically as useful as <see cref="DeviceMotionEvent.Acceleration"/>,<br/>but may be the only value available on devices that aren&amp;apos;t able to remove gravity from<br/>the acceleration data, such as on devices that don&amp;apos;t have a gyroscope.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <c>accelerationIncludingGravity</c>&amp;apos;s name can be misleading. This property represents acceleration including <strong>the effects of</strong> gravity. For example, if a device is lying flat on a horizontal surface with the screen pointing up, gravity would be -9.8 along the Z axis, while <c>acceleration.z</c> would be 0 and <c>accelerationIncludingGravity.z</c> would be 9.8. Similarly, if a device is in free fall with its screen horizontal and pointing up, gravity would be -9.8 along the Z axis, while <c>acceleration.z</c> would be -9.8 and <c>accelerationIncludingGravity.z</c> would be 0.</para></blockquote>
