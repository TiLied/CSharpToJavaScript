<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> that resolves with a boolean value indicating whether the document has access to unpartitioned cookies â€” <c>true</c> if it does, and <c>false</c> if not.The result returned by this method can be inaccurate in a couple of circumstances:<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> If the promise gets resolved and a user gesture event was being processed when the function was originally called, the resolve handler will run as if a user gesture was being processed, so it will be able to call APIs that require user activation.</blockquote></returns>
