<summary>
The <strong><c>requestStorageAccess()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Document"/> interface allows content loaded in a third-party context (i.e., embedded in an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}) to request access to third-party cookies. This is relevant to user agents that, by default, block access to <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#third-party_cookies">third-party</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API#unpartitioned_versus_partitioned_cookies">unpartitioned</see> cookies to improve privacy (e.g., to prevent tracking), and is part of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">Storage Access API</see>.

<remarks>
<para>To check whether permission to access third-party cookies has already been granted, you can call <see cref="Permissions.Query"/>, specifying the feature name <c>&amp;quot;storage-access&amp;quot;</c>.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Usage of this feature may be blocked by a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/storage-access">Permissions-Policy/storage-access</see> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy">Permissions Policy</see> set on your server. In addition, the document must pass additional browser-specific checks such as allowlists, blocklists, on-device classification, user settings, anti-<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Clickjacking">clickjacking</see> heuristics, or prompting the user for explicit permission.</para></blockquote>

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> that fulfills with <c>undefined</c> if the access to third-party cookies was granted, and rejects if access was denied.<c>requestStorageAccess()</c> requests are automatically denied unless the embedded content is currently processing a user gesture such as a tap or click (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/transient activation">transient activation</see>), or unless permission was already granted previously. If permission was not previously granted, they need to be run inside a user gesture-based event handler. The user gesture behavior depends on the state of the promise:</returns>
