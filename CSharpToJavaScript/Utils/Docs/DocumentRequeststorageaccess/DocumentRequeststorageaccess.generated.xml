<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> that fulfills with <c>undefined</c> if the access to unpartitioned cookies was granted, and rejects if access was denied.<c>requestStorageAccess()</c> requests are automatically denied unless the embedded content is currently processing a user gesture such as a tap or click (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/transient activation">transient activation</see>), or unless permission was already granted previously. If permission was not previously granted, they need to be run inside a user gesture-based event handler. The user gesture behavior depends on the state of the promise:</returns>
