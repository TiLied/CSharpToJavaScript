<DocumentFragment>
<summary>
The <strong><c>DocumentFragment</c></strong> interface represents a minimal document object that has no parent.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>It is used as a lightweight version of <see cref="Document"/> that stores a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document. The key difference is due to the fact that the document fragment isn't part of the active document tree structure. Changes made to the fragment don't affect the document.</para><para></para>
