<DynamicsCompressorNode>
<summary>
The <c>DynamicsCompressorNode</c> interface provides a compression effect, which lowers the volume of the loudest parts of the signal in order to help prevent clipping and distortion that can occur when multiple sounds are played and multiplexed together at once. This is often used in musical production and game audio. <c>DynamicsCompressorNode</c> is an <see cref="AudioNode"/> that has exactly one input and one output.
