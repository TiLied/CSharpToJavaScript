<EditContextCharacterBounds>
<summary>
The <strong><c>characterBounds()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="EditContext."/> interface returns an {{jsxref("Array")}} containing the list of bounding rectangles for the characters in the <c>EditContext</c> object.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The position and size of the characters in an <c>EditContext</c> object is used by the operating system to correctly position platform-specific editing-related UI surfaces such as an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Input Method Editor">Input Method Editor</see> (IME) window when needed. This is especially important in situations where the operating system can't automatically detect the position and size of the characters, such as when rendering text in a <c>&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;</c> element.</para><para>Web developers will most likely be interested in using the <see cref="EditContext.Characterboundsupdate_event."/> event together with the <see cref="EditContext.UpdateCharacterBounds."/> method to update the character bounds when the operating system indicates that it requires information about the position and size of the characters.</para><para>The <c>characterBounds()</c> method returns the list of character bounds that were last updated with <c>updateCharacterBounds()</c>. The list doesn&amp;apos;t contain an item for every character in the <c>EditContext</c> object, only for the characters that were updated with <c>updateCharacterBounds()</c>. To know where the characters are located in the <c>EditContext</c> object, use the <see cref="EditContext.CharacterBoundsRangeStart."/> property.</para>
