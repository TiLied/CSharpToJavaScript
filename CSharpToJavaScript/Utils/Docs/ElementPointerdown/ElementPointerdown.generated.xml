<summary>
The <c>pointerdown</c> event is fired when a pointer becomes active. For mouse, it is fired when the device transitions from no buttons pressed to at least one button pressed. For touch, it is fired when physical contact is made with the digitizer. For pen, it is fired when the stylus makes physical contact with the digitizer.

<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> For touchscreen browsers that allow <see href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dfn-direct-manipulation">direct manipulation</see>, a <c>pointerdown</c> event triggers <see href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dfn-implicit-pointer-capture">implicit pointer capture</see>, which causes the target to capture all subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing target. Accordingly, <c>pointerover</c>, <c>pointerenter</c>, <c>pointerleave</c>, and <c>pointerout</c> <strong>will not fire</strong> as long as this capture is set. The capture can be released manually by calling <see cref="'element.ReleasePointerCapture'"/> on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a <c>pointerup</c> or <c>pointercancel</c> event.</para></blockquote>
