<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>composed</c></strong> property of the<br/><see cref="Event"/> interface returns a boolean value which indicates whether<br/>or not the event will propagate across the shadow DOM boundary into the standard DOM.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>All UA-dispatched UI events are composed (click/touch/mouseover/copy/paste, etc.). Most<br/>other types of events are not composed, and so will return <c>false</c>. For<br/>example, this includes synthetic events that are created without their<br/><c>composed</c> option set to <c>true</c>.</para><para>Propagation only occurs if the <see cref="Event.Bubbles"/> property is also<br/><c>true</c>. However, capturing only composed events are also handled at host as<br/>if they were in <c>AT_TARGET</c> phase. You can determine the path the event will<br/>follow through the shadow root to the DOM root by calling<br/><see cref="Event.ComposedPath"/>.</para>

</remarks>
<value>A boolean value which is <c>true</c> if the event will cross from the<br/>shadow DOM into the standard DOM after reaching the shadow root. (That is, the first<br/>node in the shadow DOM in which the event began to propagate.)If this value is <c>false</c>, the shadow root will be the last node to be<br/>offered the event.</value>
