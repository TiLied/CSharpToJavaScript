<EventCurrentTarget>
<summary>
The <strong><c>currentTarget</c></strong> read-only property of the<br/><see cref="Event"/> interface identifies the current target for the event, as the event<br/>traverses the DOM. It always refers to the element to which the event handler has been<br/>attached, as opposed to <see cref="Event.Target"/>, which identifies the element on<br/>which the event occurred and which may be its descendant.
