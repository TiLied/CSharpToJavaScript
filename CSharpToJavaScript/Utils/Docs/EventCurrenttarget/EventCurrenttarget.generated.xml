<EventCurrentTarget>
<summary>
The <strong><c>currentTarget</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="Event"/> interface identifies the element to which the event handler has been attached.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This will not always be the same as the element on which the event was fired, because the event may have fired on a descendant of the element with the handler, and then <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Event_bubbling">bubbled</see> up to the element with the handler. The element on which the event was fired is given by <see cref="Event.Target"/>.</para><para>Note that the value of <c>currentTarget</c> is only available in a handler for the event. Outside an event handler it will be <c>null</c>. This means that, for example, if you take a reference to the <c>Event</c> object inside an event handler and then access its <c>currentTarget</c> property outside the event handler, its value will be <c>null</c>.</para>
