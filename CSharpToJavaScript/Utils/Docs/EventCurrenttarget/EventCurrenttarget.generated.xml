<EventCurrentTarget>
<summary>
The <strong><c>currentTarget</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="Event"/> interface identifies the element to which the event handler has been attached.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This will not always be the same as the element on which the event was fired, because the event may have fired on a descendant of the element with the handler, and then <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling">bubbled</see> up to the element with the handler. The element on which the event was fired is given by <see cref="Event.Target"/>.</para>
