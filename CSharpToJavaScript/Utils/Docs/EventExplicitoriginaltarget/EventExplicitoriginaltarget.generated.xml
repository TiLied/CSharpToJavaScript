<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>explicitOriginalTarget</c></strong> property of the <see cref="Event"/> interface returns the non-anonymous original target of the event.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the event was retargeted for some reason other than an anonymous boundary crossing, this will be set to the target before the retargeting occurs.</para><para>For example, mouse events are retargeted to their parent node when they happen over text nodes (see <see href="https://bugzil.la/185889">Webkit bug 185889</see>), and in that case <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget"><c>currentTarget</c></see> will show the parent while this property will show the text node.</para><para>This property also differs from <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/originalTarget"><c>originalTarget</c></see> in that it will never contain anonymous content.</para>
