<Events>
<summary>
Each event is represented by an object that is based on the <see cref="Event."/> interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened. The documentation for every event has a table (near the top) that includes a link to the associated event interface, and other relevant information. A full list of the different event types is given in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event#introduction">Event &amp;gt; Interfaces based on Event</see>.
