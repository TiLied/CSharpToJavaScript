<ExtendableEventWaitUntil>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ExtendableEvent.waitUntil()</c></strong><br/>method tells the event dispatcher that work is ongoing. It can also be used to detect<br/>whether that work was successful. In service workers, <c>waitUntil()</c> tells<br/>the browser that work is ongoing until the promise settles, and it shouldn&amp;apos;t terminate<br/>the service worker if it wants that work to complete.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The <see cref="ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/install_event"/> events in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope">service workers</see> use<br/><c>waitUntil()</c> to hold the service worker in<br/>the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Installing"/> phase until tasks<br/>complete. If the promise passed to <c>waitUntil()</c> rejects, the install is<br/>considered a failure, and the installing service worker is discarded. This is primarily<br/>used to ensure that a service worker is not considered installed until all of the core<br/>caches it depends on are successfully populated.</para><para>The <see cref="ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/activate_event"/> events in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope">service workers</see> use<br/><c>waitUntil()</c> to buffer functional events such as <c>fetch</c> and<br/><c>push</c> until the promise passed to <c>waitUntil()</c> settles. This<br/>gives the service worker time to update database schemas and delete outdated<br/><see cref="Cache"/>, so other events can rely on a completely upgraded state.</para><para>The <c>waitUntil()</c> method must be initially called within the event callback,<br/>but after that it can be called multiple times, until all the promises passed to it<br/>settle.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> The behavior described in the above paragraph was fixed in<br/>Firefox 43 (see <see href="https://bugzil.la/1180274">Firefox bug 1180274</see>).</para></blockquote>
