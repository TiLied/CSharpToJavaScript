<para><c>FencedFrameConfig</c> objects cannot be constructed manually via JavaScript. They are returned from a source such as the <see href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/private-advertising/protected-audience">Protected Audience API</see> and set as the value of <see cref="HTMLFencedFrameElement.Config"/>.</para><para>A <c>FencedFrameConfig</c> object instance has an exposed method, but it also maps to internal config information containing opaque properties not accessible from JavaScript.
