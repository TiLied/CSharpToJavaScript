<summary>
The <strong><c>FileList</c></strong> interface represents an object of this type returned by the <c>files</c> property of the HTML <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input">input</see> element; this lets you access the list of files selected with the <c>&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</c> element. It's also used for a list of files dropped into web content when using the drag and drop API; see the <see cref="DataTransfer"/> object for details on this usage.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>All <c>&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;</c> element nodes have a <c>files</c> attribute of type <c>FileList</c> on them which allows access to the items in this list. For example, if the HTML includes the following file input:</para><para>The following line of code fetches the first file in the node's file list as a <see cref="File"/> object:</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> This interface was an <see href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74630989/why-use-domstringlist-rather-than-an-array/74641156#74641156">attempt to create an unmodifiable list</see> and only continues to be supported to not break code that&amp;apos;s already using it. Modern APIs use types that wrap around ECMAScript array types instead, so you can treat them like ECMAScript arrays, and at the same time impose additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items read-only).</para></blockquote>
