<summary>
The <strong><c>FileList</c></strong> interface represents an object of this type returned by the <c>files</c> property of the HTML <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input">input</see> element; this lets you access the list of files selected with the <c>&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</c> element. It's also used for a list of files dropped into web content when using the drag and drop API; see the <see cref="DataTransfer"/> object for details on this usage.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>All <c>&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;</c> element nodes have a <c>files</c> attribute of type <c>FileList</c> on them which allows access to the items in this list. For example, if the HTML includes the following file input:</para><para>The following line of code fetches the first file in the node's file list as a <see cref="File"/> object:</para><para>This interface was an <see href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74630989/why-use-domstringlist-rather-than-an-array/74641156#74641156">attempt to create an unmodifiable list</see> and only continues to be supported to not break code that&amp;apos;s already using it. Modern APIs represent list structures using types based on JavaScript <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">arrays</see>, thus making many array methods available, and at the same time imposing additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items read-only).</para><para>These historical reasons do not mean that you as a developer should avoid <c>FileList</c>. You don&amp;apos;t create <c>FileList</c> objects yourself, but you get them from APIs such as <see cref="HTMLInputElement.Files"/>, and these APIs are not deprecated. However, be careful of the semantic differences from a real array.</para>
