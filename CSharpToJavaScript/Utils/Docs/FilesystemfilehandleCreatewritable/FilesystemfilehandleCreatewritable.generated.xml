<FileSystemFileHandleCreateWritable>
<summary>
The <strong><c>createWritable()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="FileSystemFileHandle"/> interface creates<br/>a <see cref="'FileSystemWritableFileStream'"/> that can be used to write to a file.<br/>The method returns a <see cref="'Promise'"/> which resolves to this created stream.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Any changes made through the stream won&amp;apos;t be reflected in the file represented by the<br/>file handle until the stream has been closed. This is typically implemented by writing<br/>data to a temporary file, and only replacing the file represented by file handle with<br/>the temporary file when the writable filestream is closed.</para>
