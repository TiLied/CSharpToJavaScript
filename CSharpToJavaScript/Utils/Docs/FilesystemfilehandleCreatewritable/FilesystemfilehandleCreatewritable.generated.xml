<FileSystemFileHandleCreateWritable>
<summary>
The <strong><c>createWritable()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="FileSystemFileHandle"/> interface creates a <see cref="'FileSystemWritableFileStream'"/> that can be used to write to a file.<br/>The method returns a <see cref="'Promise'"/> which resolves to this created stream.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Any changes made through the stream won&amp;apos;t be reflected in the file represented by the file handle until the stream has been closed.<br/>This is typically implemented by writing data to a temporary file, and only replacing the file represented by file handle with the temporary file when the writable file stream is closed.</para>
