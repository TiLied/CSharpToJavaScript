<summary>
The <strong><c>FileSystemSyncAccessHandle</c></strong> interface of the {{domxref(&amp;quot;File System API&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;File System API&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nocode&amp;quot;)}} represents a synchronous handle to a file system entry.

<remarks>
<para>This class is only accessible inside dedicated <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</see> (so that its methods do not block execution on the main thread) for files within the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system">origin private file system</see>, which is not visible to end-users.</para><para>As a result, its methods are not subject to the same security checks as methods running on files within the user-visible file system, and so are much more performant. This makes them suitable for significant, large-scale file updates such as <see href="https://www.sqlite.org/wasm">SQLite</see> database modifications.</para><para>The interface is accessed through the <see cref="'FileSystemFileHandle.CreateSyncAccessHandle'"/> method.</para><blockquote><para>In earlier versions of the spec, <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Close"/>, <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Flush"/>, <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.GetSize"/>, and <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Truncate"/> were wrongly specified as asynchronous methods, and older versions of some browsers implement them in this way. However, all current browsers that support these methods implement them as synchronous methods.</para></blockquote>
