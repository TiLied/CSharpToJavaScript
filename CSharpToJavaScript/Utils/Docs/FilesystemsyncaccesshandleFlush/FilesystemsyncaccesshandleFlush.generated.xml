<FileSystemSyncAccessHandleFlush>
<summary>
The <strong><c>flush()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle"/> interface persists any changes made to the file associated with the handle via the <see cref="'FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Write'"/> method to disk.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Bear in mind that you only need to call this method if you need the changes committed to disk at a specific time, otherwise you can leave the underlying operating system to handle this when it sees fit, which should be OK in most cases.</para><blockquote><para>In earlier versions of the spec, <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Close"/>, <c>flush()</c>, <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.GetSize"/>, and <see cref="FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.Truncate"/> were wrongly specified as asynchronous methods, and older versions of some browsers implement them in this way. However, all current browsers that support these methods implement them as synchronous methods.</para></blockquote>
