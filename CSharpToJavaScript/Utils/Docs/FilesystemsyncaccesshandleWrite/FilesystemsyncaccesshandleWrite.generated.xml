<remarks>
<para>Files within the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system">origin private file system</see> are not visible to end-users, therefore are not subject to the same security checks as methods running on files within the user-visible file system. As a result, writes performed using <c>FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.write()</c> are much more performant. This makes them suitable for significant, large-scale file updates such as <see href="https://www.sqlite.org/wasm">SQLite</see> database modifications.</para>
