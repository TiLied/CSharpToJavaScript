<summary>
The <strong><c>truncate()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="FileSystemWritableFileStream"/> interface resizes the file associated with the stream to be the specified size in bytes.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the size specified is larger than the current file size this pads the file with <c>null</c> bytes, otherwise it truncates the file.</para><para>The file cursor is also updated when <c>truncate()</c> is called.<br/>If the offset is smaller than the size, it remains unchanged.<br/>If the offset is larger than size, the offset is set to that size.<br/>This ensures that subsequent writes do not error.</para><para>No changes are written to the actual file on disk until the stream has been closed.<br/>Changes are typically written to a temporary file instead.</para>
