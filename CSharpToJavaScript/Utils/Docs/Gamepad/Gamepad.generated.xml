<summary>
HTML provides the necessary components for rich, interactive game development. Technologies like <c>&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;</c>, WebGL, <c>&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;</c>, and <c>&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;</c>, along with JavaScript implementations, support tasks that provide similar, if not the same, features as native code. The Gamepad API allows developers and designers to access and use gamepads and other game controllers.

<para>The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API">Gamepad API</see> introduces new events on the <see cref="Window"/> object for reading gamepad and controller (hereby referred to as <strong>gamepad</strong>) state. In addition to these events, the API also adds a <see cref="Gamepad"/> object, which you can use to query the state of a connected gamepad, and a <see cref="Navigator.GetGamepads"/> method which you can use to get a list of gamepads known to the page.</para>
