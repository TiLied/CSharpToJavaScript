<summary>
The <strong><c>&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;</c></strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</see> element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary">summary</see> element.

<remarks>
<para>A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. The contents of the <c>&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;</c> element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.</para><para>EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/details.html", "tabbed-shorter")</para><para>A <c>&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;</c> widget can be in one of two states. The default <strong>closed</strong> state displays only the triangle and the label inside <c>&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;</c> (or a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see>-defined default string if no <c>&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;</c>).</para><para>When the user clicks on the widget or focuses it then presses the space bar, it &amp;quot;twists&amp;quot; open, revealing its contents. The common use of a triangle which rotates or twists around to represent opening or closing the widget is why these are sometimes called &amp;quot;twisty&amp;quot;.</para><para>You can use CSS to style the disclosure widget, and you can programmatically open and close the widget by setting/removing its <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#open"><c>open</c></see> attribute. Unfortunately, at this time, there&amp;apos;s no built-in way to animate the transition between open and closed.</para><para>By default when closed, the widget is only tall enough to display the disclosure triangle and summary. When open, it expands to display the details contained within.</para><para>Fully standards-compliant implementations automatically apply the CSS <c>{{cssxref(&amp;quot;display&amp;quot;)}}: list-item</c> to the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary">summary</see> element. You can use this to customize its appearance further.
