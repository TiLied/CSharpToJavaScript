<para>The element is presented as a one-line plain text editor control in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, usually by replacing each character with a symbol such as the asterisk (&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;) or a dot (&amp;quot;â€¢&amp;quot;).<br/>This character will vary depending on the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see> and operating system.</para><para>EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/input-password.html", "tabbed-standard")</para><para>The precise behavior of the entry process may vary from browser to browser.<br/>Some browsers display the typed character for a moment before obscuring it, while others allow the user to toggle the display of plain-text on and off.<br/>Both approaches help a user check that they entered the intended password, which can be particularly difficult on mobile devices.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords (such as login forms) should be served over HTTPS.<br/>Many browsers now implement mechanisms to warn against insecure login forms; see <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords">Insecure passwords</see>.</para></blockquote>

<value>The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value"><c>value</c></see> attribute contains a string whose value is the current contents of the text editing control being used to enter the password. If the user hasn&amp;apos;t entered anything yet, this value is an empty string (<c>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</c>). If the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#required"><c>required</c></see> property is specified, then the password edit box must contain a value other than an empty string to be valid.If the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#pattern"><c>pattern</c></see> attribute is specified, the content of a <c>password</c> control is only considered valid if the value passes validation; see <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#validation">Validation</see> for more information.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The line feed (U+000A) and carriage return (U+000D) characters are not permitted in a <c>password</c> value. When setting the value of a password control, line feed and carriage return characters are stripped out of the value.</blockquote></value>
