<HTMLAllCollection>
<summary>
The <strong><c>HTMLAllCollection</c></strong> interface represents a collection of <strong>all</strong> of the document&amp;apos;s elements, accessible by index (like an array) and by the element&amp;apos;s <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id"><c>id</c></see>. It is returned by the <see cref="Document.All"/> property.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para><c>HTMLAllCollection</c> has a very similar shape to <see cref="HTMLCollection"/>, but there are many subtle behavior differences â€” for example, <c>HTMLAllCollection</c> can be called as a function, and its <c>item()</c> method can be called with a string representing an element&amp;apos;s <c>id</c> or <c>name</c> attribute.</para>
