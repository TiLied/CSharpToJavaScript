<HTMLElementAutofocus>
<summary>
The <strong><c>autofocus</c></strong> property of the <see cref="HTMLElement"/> interface represents a boolean value reflecting the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#autofocus"><c>autofocus</c></see> HTML global attribute, which indicates whether the control should be focused when the page loads, or when dialog or popover become shown if specified in an element inside <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">dialog</see> elements or elements whose popover attribute is set.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Only one form-associated element inside a document, or a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">dialog</see> element, or an element whose <c>popover</c> attribute is set, can have this attribute specified. If there are several, the first element with the attribute set inserted, usually the first such element on the page, gets the initial focus.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>Setting this property doesn&amp;apos;t set the focus to the associated element: it merely tells the browser to focus to it when <strong>the element is inserted</strong> in the document. Setting it after the insertion, that is most of the time after the document load, has no visible effect.</para></blockquote>
