<summary>
The <see cref="HTMLImageElement"/> property <strong><c>alt</c></strong> provides fallback (alternate) text to display when the image specified by the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">img</see> element is not loaded.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This may be the case because of an error, because the user has disabled the loading of images, or because the image hasn&amp;apos;t finished loading yet.</para><para>Perhaps the most important reason to use the <c>alt</c> property is to support <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility">accessibility</see>, as the <c>alt</c> text may be used by screen readers and other assistive technologies to help differently-abled users make full use of your content.<br/>It will be read aloud or sent to the touch device, for example, to support visually impaired users.</para><blockquote><para><strong>Think of it like this:</strong> When choosing <c>alt</c> strings for your images, imagine what you would say when reading the page to someone over the phone without mentioning that there&amp;apos;s an image on the page.</para></blockquote><para>The alternate text is displayed in the space the image would occupy and should be able to take the place of the image <strong>without altering the meaning of the page</strong>.</para>

</remarks>
<value>A string which contains the alternate text to display when the image is not loaded or for use by assistive devices.The <c>alt</c> attribute is officially mandatory; it&amp;apos;s meant to always be specified.<br/>If the image doesn&amp;apos;t require a fallback (such as for an image which is decorative or an advisory icon of minimal importance), you may specify an empty string (<c>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</c>).<br/>For compatibility reasons, browsers generally will accept an image without an <c>alt</c> attribute, but you should try to get into the habit of using it.</value>
