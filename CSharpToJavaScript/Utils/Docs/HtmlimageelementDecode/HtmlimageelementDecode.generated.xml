<HTMLImageElementDecode>
<summary>
The <strong><c>decode()</c></strong><br/>method of the <see cref="HTMLImageElement"/> interface returns a<br/><see cref="Promise"/> that resolves when the image is decoded and it is safe to append<br/>the image to the DOM.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This can be used to initiate loading of the image prior<br/>to attaching it to an element in the DOM (or adding it to the DOM as a new element), so<br/>that the image can be rendered immediately upon being added to the DOM. This, in turn,<br/>prevents the rendering of the next frame after adding the image to the DOM from causing<br/>a delay while the image loads.</para>

</remarks>
<returns>A <see cref="'Promise'"/> which is resolved once the image data is ready to be used.</returns>
