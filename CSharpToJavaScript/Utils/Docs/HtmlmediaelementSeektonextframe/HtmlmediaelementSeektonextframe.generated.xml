<remarks>
<blockquote class="WARNING"><h5>WARNING</h5><para><strong>Warning:</strong> This non-standard method is part of an experimentation process around support for<br/>non-real-time access to media for tasks including filtering, editing, and so forth.<br/>You should <strong>not</strong> use this method in production code, because its implementation<br/>may change—or be removed outright—without notice. You are, however, invited to<br/>experiment with it.</para></blockquote><para>This method lets you access frames of video media without the media being performed in<br/>real time. This also lets you access media using frames as a seek unit rather than<br/>timecodes (albeit only by seeking one frame at a time until you get to the frame you<br/>want). Possible uses for this method include filtering and editing of video content.</para><para>This method returns immediately, returning a <see cref="Promise"/>, whose fulfillment<br/>handler is called when the seek operation is complete. In addition, a<br/><see cref="HTMLMediaElement/seeked_event"/> event is sent to let interested parties know that a seek has taken<br/>place. If the seek fails because the media is already at the last frame, a<br/><see cref="HTMLMediaElement/seeked_event"/> event occurs, followed immediately by an <see cref="HTMLMediaElement/ended_event"/> event.</para><para>If there is no video on the media element, or the media isn&amp;apos;t seekable, nothing<br/>happens.</para>
