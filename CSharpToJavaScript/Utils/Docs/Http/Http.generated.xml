<summary>
<strong><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong></strong> is an <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer">application-layer</see> protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server model</see>, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol">stateless protocol</see>, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
