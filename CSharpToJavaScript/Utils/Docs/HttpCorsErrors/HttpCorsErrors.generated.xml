<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</see> (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS">CORS</see>) is a standard that allows a server to relax the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</see>. This is used to explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others. For example, if a site offers an embeddable service, it may be necessary to relax certain restrictions. Setting up such a CORS configuration isn&amp;apos;t necessarily easy and may present some challenges. In these pages, we&amp;apos;ll look into some common CORS error messages and how to resolve them.

<remarks>
<para>If the CORS configuration isn&amp;apos;t setup correctly, the browser console will present an error like <c>&amp;quot;Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at $somesite&amp;quot;</c> indicating that the request was blocked due to violating the CORS security rules. This might not necessarily be a set-up mistake, though. It&amp;apos;s possible that the request is in fact intentionally being disallowed by the user&amp;apos;s web application and remote external service. However, If the endpoint is meant to be available, some debugging is needed to succeed.</para>
