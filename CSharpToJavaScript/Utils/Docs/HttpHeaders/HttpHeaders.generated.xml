<para>Custom proprietary headers have historically been used with an <c>X-</c> prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012 because of the inconveniences it caused when nonstandard fields became standard in <see href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6648">RFC 6648</see>; others are listed in an <see href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml#perm-headers">IANA registry</see>, whose original content was defined in <see href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4229">RFC 4229</see>.
