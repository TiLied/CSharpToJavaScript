<summary>
The <strong><c>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</c></strong> response header<br/>tells browsers whether to expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code when the<br/>request's credentials mode (<see cref="Request.Credentials."/>) is <c>include</c>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>When a request's credentials mode (<see cref="Request.Credentials."/>) is<br/><c>include</c>, browsers will only expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code<br/>if the <c>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</c> value is <c>true</c>.</para><para>Credentials are cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates.</para><para>When used as part of a response to a preflight request, this indicates whether or not<br/>the actual request can be made using credentials. Note that simple {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}<br/>requests are not preflighted. So, if a request is made for a resource with<br/>credentials, and if this header is not returned with the resource, the response is ignored<br/>by the browser and not returned to the web content.</para><para>The <c>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</c> header works in conjunction with the<br/><see cref="XMLHttpRequest.WithCredentials."/> property or with the<br/><c>credentials</c> option in the <see cref="Request.Request."/><br/>constructor of the Fetch API. For a CORS request with credentials, for browsers<br/>to expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code, both the server (using the<br/><c>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</c> header) and the client (by setting the<br/>credentials mode for the XHR, Fetch, or Ajax request) must indicate that they&amp;apos;re opting<br/>into including credentials.</para>
