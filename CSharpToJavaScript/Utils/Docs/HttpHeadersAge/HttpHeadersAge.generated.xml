If it is <c>Age: 0</c>, it was probably fetched from the origin server; otherwise, it was usually calculated as<br/>a difference between the proxy's current date and the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date">Date</see> general header included in the HTTP response.</para>
