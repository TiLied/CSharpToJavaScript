<summary>
The <strong><c>Connection</c></strong> general header controls whether the<br/>network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent<br/>is <c>keep-alive</c>, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for<br/>subsequent requests to the same server to be done.
