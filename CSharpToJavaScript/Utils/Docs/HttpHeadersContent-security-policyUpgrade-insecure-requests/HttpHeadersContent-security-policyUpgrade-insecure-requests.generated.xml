<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The <c>upgrade-insecure-requests</c> directive is evaluated before<br/>{{CSP("block-all-mixed-content")}} and if it is set, the latter is effectively a<br/>no-op. It is recommended to set either directive, but not both, unless you want to<br/>force HTTPS on older browsers that do not force it after a redirect to HTTP.</blockquote>

<remarks>
<para>The <c>upgrade-insecure-requests</c> directive will not ensure that users<br/>visiting your site via links on third-party sites will be upgraded to HTTPS for the<br/>top-level navigation and thus does not replace the<br/>{{HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security")}} (<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HSTS">HSTS</see>) header, which<br/>should still be set with an appropriate <c>max-age</c> to ensure that users are<br/>not subject to SSL stripping attacks.</para>
