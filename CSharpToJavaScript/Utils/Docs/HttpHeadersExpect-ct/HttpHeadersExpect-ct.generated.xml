<HTTPHeadersExpect-CT>
<summary>
The <c>Expect-CT</c> header lets sites opt in to reporting and/or enforcement of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency">Certificate Transparency</see> requirements. Certificate Transparency (CT) aims to prevent the use of misissued certificates for that site from going unnoticed.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Only Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers implemented <c>Expect-CT</c>, and Chromium has deprecated the header from version 107, because Chromium now enforces CT by default. See the <see href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/6244547273687040">Chrome Platform Status</see> update.</para><para>CT requirements can be satisfied via any one of the following mechanisms:</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> When a site enables the <c>Expect-CT</c> header, they are requesting that the browser check that any certificate for that site appears in <strong><see href="https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-community-site/blob/master/docs/google/known-logs.md">public CT logs</see></strong>.</para></blockquote><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Browsers <strong>ignore</strong> the <c>Expect-CT</c> header over HTTP; the header only has effect on HTTPS connections.</para></blockquote><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> The <c>Expect-CT</c> is mostly obsolete since June 2021. Since May 2018, all new TLS certificates are expected to support SCTs by default. Certificates issued before March 2018 were allowed to have a lifetime of 39 months, so they had expired in June 2021. Chromium plans to deprecate <c>Expect-CT</c> header and to eventually remove it.</para></blockquote>
