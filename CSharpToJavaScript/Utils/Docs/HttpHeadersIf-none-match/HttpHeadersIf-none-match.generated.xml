<summary>
The <strong><c>If-None-Match</c></strong> HTTP request header makes the request conditional. For {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, the server will return the requested resource, with a {{HTTPStatus("200")}} status, only if it doesn't have an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</see> matching the given ones. For other methods, the request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource's <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</see> doesn't match any of the values listed.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>When the condition fails for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, then the server must return HTTP status code 304 (Not Modified). For methods that apply server-side changes, the status code 412 (Precondition Failed) is used. Note that the server generating a 304 response MUST generate any of the following header fields that would have been sent in a 200 (OK) response to the same request: Cache-Control, Content-Location, Date, ETag, Expires, and Vary.</para><para>The comparison with the stored <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</see> uses the <strong>weak comparison algorithm</strong>, meaning two files are considered identical if the content is equivalent â€” they don&amp;apos;t have to be identical byte by byte. For example, two pages that differ by their creation date in the footer would still be considered identical.</para><para>When used in combination with <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since">If-Modified-Since</see>, <strong><c>If-None-Match</c></strong> has precedence (if the server supports it).</para><para>There are two common use cases:</para>
