<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The non-standard <strong><c>Large-Allocation</c></strong> response header tells the browser that the page being loaded is going to want to perform a large allocation.<br/>It&amp;apos;s not implemented in current versions of any browser, but is harmless to send to any browser.

<remarks>
<para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</see> or asm.js applications can use large<br/>contiguous blocks of allocated memory. For complex games, for example, these allocations<br/>can be quite large, sometimes as large as 1GB. The <c>Large-Allocation</c> tells<br/>the browser that the web content in the to-be-loaded page is going to want to perform a<br/>large contiguous memory allocation and the browser can react to this header by starting<br/>a dedicated process for the to-be-loaded document, for example.</para>
