<HTTPHeadersMax-Forwards>
<summary>
The <strong><c>Max-Forwards</c></strong> request HTTP header is used with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE"><c>TRACE</c></see> method to limit the number of nodes (usually proxies) that request goes through. Its value is an integer value indicating the <strong>maximum amount</strong> of nodes it must visit. At each node, the value is decremented and the <c>TRACE</c> request is forwarded to the next node, until the destination is reached, or the received value of <c>Max-Forwards</c> is zero. The request is then sent back, except for some headers, as the body of a <c>200 OK</c> response.

<remarks>
<para>If the <c>Max-Forwards</c> header is not present in a <c>TRACE</c> request, a node will assume that there is no maximum number of forwards.</para>
