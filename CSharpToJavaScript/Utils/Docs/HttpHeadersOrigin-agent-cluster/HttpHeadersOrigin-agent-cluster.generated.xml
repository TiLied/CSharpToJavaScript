<summary>
The <strong><c>Origin-Agent-Cluster</c></strong> HTTP response header is used to request that the associated <see cref="Document."/> should be placed in an <strong>origin-keyed agent cluster</strong>. This means that operating system resources (for example, the operating system process) used to evaluate the document should be shared only with other documents from the same <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin">origin</see>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The effect of this is that a resource-intensive document will be less likely to degrade the performance of documents from other origins.</para><para>Modern web browsers have a multiprocess architecture in which pages from different origins can run in different operating system processes. This is important for performance, because it means that a resource-intensive page will not have as much of an impact on other pages that the user has open.</para><para>However, browsers can't as a general rule run <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/site">site</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin">origin</see> pages in different processes, because of certain DOM APIs that depend on same-site, cross-origin communication. For example, by default, pages from the following two origins will share the same operating system resources:</para><para>By setting the <c>Origin-Agent-Cluster</c> header, a page can request that the browser allocate dedicated resources to this origin that are not shared with any other origins.</para><para>The browser is not required to honor the request. If it does, the <see cref="Window.OriginAgentCluster."/> property returns <c>true</c>, and the window is not able to do the following things, which all depend on same-site, cross-origin communication:</para><para>Origin-keyed agent clusters should not be viewed as a security feature: browsers may ignore the request for various reasons, or choose to implement it in a way that does not provide memory protection (for example, using separate threads instead of separate processes). Instead, this feature is a hint that the user experience would be improved if this origin were allocated dedicated resources.</para><para>For example, suppose your site includes a page from one origin that embeds a same-site, cross-origin iframe which runs a resource-intensive game. By setting <c>Origin-Agent-Cluster</c> on the document in the iframe, you can prevent the game from affecting the performance of the main page.</para><para>The browser will ensure that all pages from a given origin are either origin-keyed or they are not. This means that:</para><para>To avoid this kind of unpredictable situation, you should set this header for all pages from a given origin, or none of them.</para>
