<HTTPHeadersPermissions-PolicyExecution-while-out-of-viewport>
<summary>
Specifically, where a defined policy blocks execution of task rendering while content is not in the visible viewport, while that condition is true, the content will be put in the frozen state as defined in the <see href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/page-lifecycle-api">Page Lifecycle API</see>. This stops execution of freezable tasks such as JavaScript timers (e.g. <see cref="SetTimeout."/>) and <see cref="Fetch."/> callbacks.
