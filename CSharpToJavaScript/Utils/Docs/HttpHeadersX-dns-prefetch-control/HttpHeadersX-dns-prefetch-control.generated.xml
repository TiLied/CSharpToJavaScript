<summary>
The <strong><c>X-DNS-Prefetch-Control</c></strong> HTTP response header controls<br/>DNS prefetching, a feature by which browsers proactively perform domain name resolution<br/>on both links that the user may choose to follow as well as URLs for items referenced by<br/>the document, including images, CSS, JavaScript, and so forth.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This prefetching is performed in the background, so that the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS">DNS</see> is<br/>likely to have been resolved by the time the referenced items are needed. This reduces<br/>latency when the user clicks a link.</para>
