But if a client connection passes through any <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">forward or reverse</see> proxies, the server only<br/>sees the final proxy&amp;apos;s IP address, which is often of little use. That&amp;apos;s especially true if<br/>the final proxy is a load balancer which is part of the same installation<br/>as the server. So, to provide a more-useful client IP address to the server, the <c>X-Forwarded-For</c> request header is<br/>used.</para><para>For detailed guidance on using this header, see the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#parsing">Parsing</see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#selecting_an_ip_address">Selecting an IP address</see> sections.</para><para>A standardized version of this header is the HTTP <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded">Forwarded</see> header.</para>
