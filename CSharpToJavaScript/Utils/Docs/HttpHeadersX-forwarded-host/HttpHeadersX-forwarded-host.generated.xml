<summary>
The <strong><c>X-Forwarded-Host</c></strong> (XFH) header is a de-facto standard<br/>header for identifying the original host requested by the client in the<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host">Host</see> HTTP request header.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Host names and ports of reverse proxies (load balancers, CDNs) may differ from the<br/>origin server handling the request, in that case the <c>X-Forwarded-Host</c><br/>header is useful to determine which Host was originally used.</para>
