<summary>
The <strong><c>X-Forwarded-Proto</c></strong> (XFP) header is a de-facto standard<br/>header for identifying the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to<br/>your proxy or load balancer. Your server access logs contain the protocol used between<br/>the server and the load balancer, but not the protocol used between the client and the<br/>load balancer. To determine the protocol used between the client and the load balancer,<br/>the <c>X-Forwarded-Proto</c> request header can be used.
