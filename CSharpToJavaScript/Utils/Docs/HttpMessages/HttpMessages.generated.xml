<summary>
HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: <strong>requests</strong> sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and <strong>responses</strong>, the answer from the server.

<remarks>
<para>HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII, and span over multiple lines. In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages were openly sent across the connection. In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements.</para><para>Web developers, or webmasters, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action. They provide HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces.</para><para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orghttpmsg2.png">From a user-, script-, or server- generated event, an HTTP/1.x msg is generated, and if HTTP/2 is in use, it is binary framed into an HTTP/2 stream, then sent.</see></para><para>The HTTP/2 binary framing mechanism has been designed to not require any alteration of the APIs or config files applied: it is broadly transparent to the user.</para><para>HTTP requests, and responses, share similar structure and are composed of:</para><para>The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as the <strong>head</strong> of the requests, whereas its payload is known as the <strong>body</strong>.</para><para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orghttpmsgstructure2.png">Requests and responses share a common structure in HTTP</see></para>
