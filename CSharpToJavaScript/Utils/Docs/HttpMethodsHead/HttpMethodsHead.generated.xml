<summary>
The <strong>HTTP </strong><strong><c>HEAD</c></strong><strong> method</strong> requests the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">headers</see> that would be returned if the <c>HEAD</c> request's URL was instead requested with the HTTP {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} method. For example, if a URL might produce a large download, a <c>HEAD</c> request could read its <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length">Content-Length</see> header to check the filesize without actually downloading the file.
