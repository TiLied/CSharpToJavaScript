<summary>
The <strong>HTTP </strong><strong><c>PATCH</c></strong><strong> request method</strong> applies partial modifications to a resource.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para><c>PATCH</c> is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD">CRUD</see> (in general, HTTP is different than <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD">CRUD</see>, and the two should not be confused).</para><para>A <c>PATCH</c> request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast this with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}; which is a complete representation of a resource.</para><para>A <c>PATCH</c> is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}; which is always idempotent. The word "idempotent" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for <c>PATCH</c>.</para><para><c>PATCH</c> (like {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}) <strong>may</strong> have side-effects on other resources.</para><para>To find out whether a server supports <c>PATCH</c>, a server can advertise its support by adding it to the list in the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Allow">Allow</see> or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods">Access-Control-Allow-Methods</see> (for <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</see>) response headers.</para><para>Another (implicit) indication that <c>PATCH</c> is allowed, is the presence of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Patch">Accept-Patch</see> header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.</para>
