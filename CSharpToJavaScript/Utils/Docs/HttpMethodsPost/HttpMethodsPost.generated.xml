<HTTPMethodsPOST>
<summary>
The <strong>HTTP </strong><strong><c>POST</c></strong><strong> method</strong> sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type">Content-Type</see> header.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The difference between {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} and <c>POST</c> is that <c>PUT</c> is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no <strong>side</strong> effect), where successive identical <c>POST</c> may have additional effects, like passing an order several times.</para><para>A <c>POST</c> request is typically sent via an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms">HTML form</see> and results in a change on the server. In this case, the content type is selected by putting the adequate string in the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#enctype"><c>enctype</c></see> attribute of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">form</see> element or the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#formenctype"><c>formenctype</c></see> attribute of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input">input</see> or <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button">button</see> elements:</para><para>When the <c>POST</c> request is sent via a method other than an HTML form — like via an <see cref="XMLHttpRequest."/> — the body can take any type. As described in the HTTP 1.1 specification, <c>POST</c> is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:</para>
<para>-<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type">Content-Type</see><br/>-<see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</see><br/>-HTTPMethod("GET")<br/></para>
