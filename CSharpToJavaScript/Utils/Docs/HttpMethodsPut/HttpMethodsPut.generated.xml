<summary>
The <strong>HTTP </strong><strong><c>PUT</c></strong><strong> request method</strong> creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The difference between <c>PUT</c> and {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} is that <c>PUT</c> is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no <strong>side</strong> effect), whereas successive identical {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.</para>
