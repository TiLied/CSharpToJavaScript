<strong>HTTP</strong> is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/protocol">protocol</see> for fetching resources such as HTML documents.<br/>It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.<br/>A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
