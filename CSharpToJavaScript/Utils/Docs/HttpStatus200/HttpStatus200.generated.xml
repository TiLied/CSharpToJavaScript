<remarks>
<para>The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method:</para><para>The successful result of a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} or a {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} is often not a <c>200 OK</c> but a {{HTTPStatus("204")}} <c>No Content</c> (or a {{HTTPStatus("201")}} <c>Created</c> when the resource is uploaded for the first time).</para>
