<HTTPStatus202>
<summary>
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <strong><c>202 Accepted</c></strong><br/>response status code indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but<br/>the processing has not been completed; in fact, processing may not have started yet. The<br/>request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when<br/>processing actually takes place.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>202 is non-committal, meaning that there is no way for the HTTP to later send an<br/>asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended<br/>for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.</para>
