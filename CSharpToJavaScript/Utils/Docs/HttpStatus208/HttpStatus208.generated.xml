<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The ability to <strong>bind</strong> a resource to several paths is an extension to the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</see> protocol (it may be received by web applications accessing a WebDAV server).<br/>Browsers accessing web pages will never encounter this status code.</blockquote>

<remarks>
<para>The HTTP <strong><c>208 Already Reported</c></strong> response code is used in a {{HTTPStatus("207")}} (<c>207 Multi-Status</c>) response to save space and avoid conflicts.<br/>If the same resource is requested several times (for example as part of a collection), with different paths, only the first one is reported with {{HTTPStatus("200")}}.<br/>Responses for all other bindings will report with this <c>208</c> status code, so no conflicts are created and the response stays shorter.</para>
