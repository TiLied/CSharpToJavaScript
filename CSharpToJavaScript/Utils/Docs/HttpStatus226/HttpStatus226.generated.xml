<remarks>
<para>In the context of delta encodings, the HTTP <strong><c>226 IM Used</c></strong> status code is set by the server to indicate that it is returning a <strong>delta</strong> to the {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request that it received.</para><para>With delta encoding a server responds to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} requests with differences (called <strong>deltas</strong>) relative to a given base document (rather than the current document). The client uses the <c>A-IM:</c> HTTP header to indicate which differencing algorithm to use and the <c>If-None-Match:</c> header to hint the server about the last version it got. The server generates a delta, sending it back in an HTTP response with the <c>226</c> status code and containing the <c>IM:</c> (with the name of the algorithm used) and <c>Delta-Base:</c> (with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</see> matching the base document associated to the delta) HTTP headers.</para><para>IM stands for <strong>instance manipulations</strong> the term used to describe an algorithm generating a <strong>delta</strong>.</para>
