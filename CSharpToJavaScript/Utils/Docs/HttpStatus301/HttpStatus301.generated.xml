<summary>
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <strong><c>301 Moved Permanently</c></strong> redirect status response code indicates that the requested resource has been definitively moved to the URL given by the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</see> headers. A browser redirects to the new URL and search engines update their links to the resource.

<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Although the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#specifications">specification</see> requires the method and the body to remain unchanged when the redirection is performed, not all user-agents meet this requirement. Use the <c>301</c> code only as a response for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods and use the {{HTTPStatus("308", "308 Permanent Redirect")}} for {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with this status.</para></blockquote>
