<HTTPStatus307>
<summary>
The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected<br/>request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to<br/>{{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, use {{HTTPStatus("303", "303 See Other")}} instead. This is<br/>useful when you want to give an answer to a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} method that is not the<br/>uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like &amp;quot;You successfully uploaded XYZ&amp;quot;).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The only difference between <c>307</c> and {{HTTPStatus("302")}} is that<br/><c>307</c> guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the<br/>redirected request is made. With <c>302</c>, some old clients were incorrectly<br/>changing the method to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}: the behavior with non-<c>GET</c><br/>methods and <c>302</c> is then unpredictable on the Web, whereas the behavior with<br/><c>307</c> is predictable. For <c>GET</c> requests, their behavior is<br/>identical.</para>
<para>-{{HTTPStatus("302", "302 Found")}}, the equivalent of this status code, but that may<br/>change the method used when it is not a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}.<br/>-{{HTTPStatus("303", "303 See Other")}}, a temporary redirect that changes the method<br/>used to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}.<br/>-{{HTTPStatus("301", "301 Moved Permanently")}}, a permanent redirect<br/></para>
