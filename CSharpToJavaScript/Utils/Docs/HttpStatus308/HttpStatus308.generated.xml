<HTTPStatus308>
<summary>
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br/><strong><c>308 Permanent Redirect</c></strong> redirect status response code<br/>indicates that the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by<br/>the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</see> headers. A browser redirects to this page and search<br/>engines update their links to the resource (in &amp;apos;SEO-speak&amp;apos;, it is said that the<br/>&amp;apos;link-juice&amp;apos; is sent to the new URL).

<remarks>
<para>The request method and the body will not be altered, whereas {{HTTPStatus("301")}} may<br/>incorrectly sometimes be changed to a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} method.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Some Web applications may use the<br/><c>308 Permanent Redirect</c> in a non-standard way and for other purposes. For<br/>example, Google Drive uses a <c>308 Resume Incomplete</c> response to indicate<br/>to the client when an incomplete upload stalled. (See <see href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads">Perform a resumable download</see> on Google Drive documentation.)</para></blockquote>
<para>-{{HTTPStatus("301", "301 Moved Permanently")}}, the equivalent of this status code, but that may<br/>change the method used when it is not a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}.<br/>-{{HTTPStatus("302", "302 Found")}}, a temporary redirect<br/></para>
