<HTTPStatus403>
<summary>
The HTTP <strong><c>403 Forbidden</c></strong> response status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This status is similar to {{HTTPStatus("401")}}, but for the <strong><c>403 Forbidden</c></strong> status code, re-authenticating makes no difference. The access is tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.</para>
