<HTTPStatus408>
<summary>
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br/><strong><c>408 Request Timeout</c></strong> response status code means that the<br/>server would like to shut down this unused connection. It is sent on an idle connection<br/>by some servers, <strong>even without any previous request by the client</strong>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A server should send the "close" <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection">Connection</see> header field in the<br/>response, since <c>408</c> implies that the server has decided to close the<br/>connection rather than continue waiting.</para><para>This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, and IE9,<br/>use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> some servers merely shut down the connection without sending<br/>this message.</para></blockquote>
