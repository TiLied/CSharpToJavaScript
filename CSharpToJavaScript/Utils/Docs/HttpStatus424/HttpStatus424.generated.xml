<HTTPStatus424>
<summary>
The HTTP <strong><c>424 Failed Dependency</c></strong> client error response code indicates that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action, and that action failed.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Regular web servers will normally not return this status code. But some other protocols, like <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</see>, can return it. For example, in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</see>, if a <c>PROPPATCH</c> request was issued, and one command fails then automatically every other command will also fail with <c>424 Failed Dependency</c>.</para>
