<summary>
The HTTP <strong><c>431 Request Header Fields Too Large</c></strong> response status code<br/>indicates that the server refuses to process the request because the request&amp;apos;s<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</see> are too long.<br/>The request <strong>may</strong> be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request headers.

<remarks>
<para>431 can be used when the <strong>total size</strong> of request headers is too large,<br/>or when a <strong>single</strong> header field is too large. To help those running into<br/>this error, indicate which of the two is the problem in the response body â€” ideally,<br/>also include which headers are too large. This lets users attempt to fix the problem,<br/>such as by clearing their cookies.</para><para>Servers will often produce this status if:</para>
