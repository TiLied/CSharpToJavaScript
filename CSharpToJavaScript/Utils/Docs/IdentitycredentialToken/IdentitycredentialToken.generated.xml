The IdP decides on the syntax and usage of it, and the RP needs to follow the instructions provided by the IdP (see <see href="https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/verify-google-id-token">Verify the Google ID token on your server side</see>, for example) to make sure they are using it correctly.</para></blockquote>
