<IdleDeadlineDidTimeout>
<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>didTimeout</c></strong> property on the<br/><strong><see cref="IdleDeadline"/></strong> interface is a Boolean value which<br/>indicates whether or not the idle callback is being invoked because the timeout interval<br/>specified when <see cref="Window.RequestIdleCallback"/> was called has expired.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If <c>didTimeout</c> is <c>true</c>, the <c>IdleDeadline</c> object&amp;apos;s<br/><see cref="IdleDeadline.TimeRemaining"/> method will return<br/>approximately 0.</para><para>Idle callbacks support the concept of a timeout in order to ensure that whatever task<br/>they&amp;apos;re meant to perform actually happens, even if the user agent never has enough idle<br/>time available. Your callback will typically check the value of <c>didTimeout</c><br/>if it needs to perform an action even if the browser is too busy to grant you the time;<br/>you should react by performing the needed task or, ideally, a minimal amount of work<br/>that can be done to keep things moving along, then schedule a new callback to try again<br/>to get the rest of the work done.</para>
