<IntersectionObserverObserve>
<summary>
The <see cref="IntersectionObserver"/> method<br/><strong><c>observe()</c></strong> adds an element to the set of target elements<br/>being watched by the <c>IntersectionObserver</c>. One observer has one set of<br/>thresholds and one root, but can watch multiple target elements for visibility changes<br/>in keeping with those.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>To stop observing the element, call<br/><see cref="IntersectionObserver.Unobserve"/>.</para><para>When the visibility of the specified element crosses over one of the observer&amp;apos;s<br/>visibility thresholds (as listed in <see cref="IntersectionObserver.Thresholds"/>), the<br/>observer&amp;apos;s callback is executed with an array of<br/><see cref="IntersectionObserverEntry"/> objects representing the intersection changes<br/>which occurred. Note that this design allows multiple elements&amp;apos; intersection changes to<br/>be processed by a single call to the callback.</para><blockquote><para>The observer <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver#callback">callback</see> will always fire the first render cycle after <c>observe()</c> is called, even if the observed element has not yet moved with respect to the viewport.<br/>This means that, for example, an element that is outside the viewport when <c>observe()</c> is called on it will result in the callback being immediately called with at least one <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry">entry</see> with <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/isIntersecting"><c>intersecting</c></see> set to <c>false</c>.<br/>An element inside the viewport will result in the callback being immediately called with at least one entry with <c>intersecting</c> set to <c>true</c>.</para></blockquote>
