<IntersectionObserverThresholds>
<summary>
The <see cref="IntersectionObserver."/> interface's read-only<br/><strong><c>thresholds</c></strong> property returns the list of intersection<br/>thresholds that was specified when the observer was instantiated with<br/><see cref="IntersectionObserver.IntersectionObserver."/>. If<br/>only one threshold ratio was provided when instantiating the object, this will be an<br/>array containing that single value.

<value>An array of intersection thresholds, originally specified using the<br/><c>threshold</c> property when instantiating the observer. If only one observer<br/>was specified, without being in an array, this value is a one-entry array containing<br/>that threshold. Regardless of the order your original <c>threshold</c> array was<br/>in, this one is always sorted in numerically increasing order.If no <c>threshold</c> option was included when<br/><c>IntersectionObserver()</c> was used to instantiate the observer, the value of<br/><c>thresholds</c> is <c>[0]</c>.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> Although the <c>options</c> object you can specify when creating an<br/><see cref="IntersectionObserver."/> has a field named<br/><c>threshold</c>, this property is called<br/><c>thresholds</c>. Confusing? Yes. If you accidentally use<br/><c>thresholds</c> as the name of the field in your <c>options</c>, the<br/><c>thresholds</c> array will wind up being <c>[0.0]</c>, which is likely<br/>not what you expect. Debugging chaos may ensue.</blockquote></value>
