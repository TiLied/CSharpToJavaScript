<value>A <see cref="DOMRectReadOnly"/> which describes the smallest rectangle that contains<br/>every part of the target element whose intersection change is being described. This<br/>value is obtained using the same algorithm as<br/><see cref="Element.GetBoundingClientRect"/>, so refer to that article for details on<br/>precisely what is done to obtain this rectangle and what is and is not included within<br/>its bounds.In the general case, however, it&amp;apos;s safe to think of this as the bounds rectangle of the<br/>target element.</value>
