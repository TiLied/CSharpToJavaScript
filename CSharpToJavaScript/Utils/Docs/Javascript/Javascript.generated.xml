<strong>JavaScript</strong> (<strong>JS</strong>) is a lightweight interpreted (or <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">just-in-time</see> compiled) programming language with <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class Function">First-class Function</see>. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Other_usage">many non-browser environments</see> also use it, such as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js">Node.js</see>, <see href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</see> and <see href="https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/">Adobe Acrobat</see>. JavaScript is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming">prototype-based</see>, multi-paradigm, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Thread">single-threaded</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing">dynamic</see> language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

<para>JavaScript&amp;apos;s dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><c>eval</c></see>), object introspection (via <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in"><c>for...in</c></see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#static_methods"><c>Object</c> utilities</see>), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString"><c>toString()</c></see>).</para><para>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.

As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some <see href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals">proposals for new ECMAScript features</see> have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the <see href="https://tc39.es/process-document/">stages</see> 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.</para><para>Do not confuse JavaScript with the <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java programming language</see> â€” <strong>JavaScript is </strong><strong><strong>not</strong></strong><strong> &amp;quot;Interpreted Java&amp;quot;</strong>.
