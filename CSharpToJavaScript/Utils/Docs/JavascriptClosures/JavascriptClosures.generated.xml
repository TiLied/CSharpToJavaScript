<summary>
A <strong>closure</strong> is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the <strong>lexical environment</strong>). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function&amp;apos;s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
