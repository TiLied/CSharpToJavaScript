<summary>
Generally speaking, a function is a &amp;quot;subprogram&amp;quot; that can be <strong>called</strong> by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the <strong>function body</strong>. Values can be <strong>passed</strong> to a function as parameters, and the function will <strong>return</strong> a value.

<remarks>
<para>In JavaScript, functions are <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function">first-class objects</see>, because they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called.</para><para>For more examples and explanations, see the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions">JavaScript guide about functions</see>.</para>

<returns>By default, if a function&amp;apos;s execution doesn&amp;apos;t end at a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return"><c>return</c></see> statement, or if the <c>return</c> keyword doesn't have an expression after it, then the return value is <see cref="Undefined"/>. The <c>return</c> statement allows you to return an arbitrary value from the function. One function call can only return one value, but you can simulate the effect of returning multiple values by returning an object or array and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">destructuring</see> the result.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> Constructors called with <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new"><c>new</c></see> have a different set of logic to determine their return values.</blockquote>The following function returns a string containing the formatted representation of a number padded with leading zeros.The following statements call the <c>padZeros</c> function.</returns>
