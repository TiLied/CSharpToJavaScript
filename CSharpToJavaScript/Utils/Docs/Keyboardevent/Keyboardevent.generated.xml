<KeyboardEvent>
<summary>
<strong><c>KeyboardEvent</c></strong> objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard. The event type (<see cref="Element/keydown_event"/>, <see cref="Element/keypress_event"/>, or <see cref="Element/keyup_event"/>) identifies what kind of keyboard activity occurred.

<remarks>
<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <c>KeyboardEvent</c> events just indicate what interaction the user had with a key on the keyboard at a low level, providing no contextual meaning to that interaction. When you need to handle text input, use the <see cref="HTMLElement/input_event"/> event instead. Keyboard events may not be fired if the user is using an alternate means of entering text, such as a handwriting system on a tablet or graphics tablet.</para></blockquote><para></para>
