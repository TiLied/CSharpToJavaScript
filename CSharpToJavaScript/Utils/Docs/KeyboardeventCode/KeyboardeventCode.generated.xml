<KeyboardEventCode>
<summary>
The <c>KeyboardEvent.code</c> property represents a physical key on the keyboard (as opposed to the character generated by pressing the key). In other words, this property returns a value that isn&amp;apos;t altered by keyboard layout or the state of the modifier keys.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the input device isn&amp;apos;t a physical keyboard, but is instead a virtual keyboard or accessibility device, the returned value will be set by the browser to match as closely as possible to what would happen with a physical keyboard, to maximize compatibility between physical and virtual input devices.</para><para>This property is useful when you want to handle keys based on their physical positions on the input device rather than the characters associated with those keys; this is especially common when writing code to handle input for games that simulate a gamepad-like environment using keys on the keyboard. Be aware, however, that you can&amp;apos;t use the value reported by <c>KeyboardEvent.code</c> to determine the character generated by the keystroke, because the keycode&amp;apos;s name may not match the actual character that&amp;apos;s printed on the key or that&amp;apos;s generated by the computer when the key is pressed.</para><para>For example, the <c>code</c> returned is &amp;quot;<c>KeyQ</c>&amp;quot; for the &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;Q&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt; key on a QWERTY layout keyboard, but the same <c>code</c> value also represents the &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt; key on Dvorak keyboards and the &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;A&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt; key on AZERTY keyboards. That makes it impossible to use the value of <c>code</c> to determine what the name of the key is to users if they&amp;apos;re not using an anticipated keyboard layout.</para><para>To determine what character corresponds with the key event, use the <see cref="KeyboardEvent.Key"/> property instead.</para>
