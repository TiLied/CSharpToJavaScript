<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The deprecated <strong><c>KeyboardEvent.keyCode</c></strong> read-only property represents a system and implementation dependent numerical code identifying the unmodified value of the pressed key.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is usually the decimal ASCII ({{RFC(20)}}) or Windows 1252 code corresponding to the key. If the key can't be identified, this value is <c>0</c>.</para><para>You should avoid using this if possible; it's been deprecated for some time. Instead, you should use <see cref="KeyboardEvent.Code"/>, if it's implemented. Unfortunately, some browsers still don't have it, so you'll have to be careful to make sure you use one which is supported on all target browsers.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Web developers shouldn&amp;apos;t use the <c>keyCode</c> attribute for printable characters when handling <c>keydown</c> and <c>keyup</c> events. As described above, the <c>keyCode</c> attribute is not useful for printable characters, especially those input with the &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;Shift&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;Alt&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt; key pressed. When implementing a shortcut key handler, the <see cref="Element/keypress_event"/> event is usually better (at least when Gecko is the runtime in use).</para></blockquote>
