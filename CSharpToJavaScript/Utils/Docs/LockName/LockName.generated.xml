<LockName>
<summary>
The <strong><c>name</c></strong> read-only property of<br/>the <see cref="Lock"/> interface returns the <strong>name</strong> passed to<br/><see cref="'LockManager.Request'"/> selected when the lock was requested.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The name of a lock is passed by script when the lock is requested. The name is selected<br/>by the developer to represent an abstract resource for which use is being coordinated<br/>across multiple tabs, workers, or other code within the origin. For example, if only one<br/>tab of a web application should be synchronizing network resources with an offline<br/>database, it could use a lock name such as <c>&amp;quot;net_db_sync&amp;quot;</c>.</para>
