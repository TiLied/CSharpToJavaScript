The <c>categories</c> member is an array of strings defining the names of categories that the application supposedly belongs to. There is no standard list of possible values, but the W3C maintains <see href="https://github.com/w3c/manifest/wiki/Categories">a list of known categories</see>.

Developers are encouraged to use lower case in the first place.</para></blockquote>
