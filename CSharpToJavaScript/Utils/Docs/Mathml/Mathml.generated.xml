<remarks>
<para><see href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml/">MathML</see> was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra systems</see>, <see href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/">EPUB</see> readers, <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</see>-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the <see href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#contm">subset focusing on semantics</see> has never been implemented in browsers while the <see href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#presm">subset focusing on math layout</see> led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.</para><para><see href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/">MathML Core</see> is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</see> and the <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/typography/opentype/spec/math">Open Font Format</see>. It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</see>, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</see>.</para><para>Below you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. MDN uses <see href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/">MathML Core</see> as a reference specification but, due to an erratic standardization history, legacy MathML features may still show up in existing implementations and web content.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to MathML Core, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases. The Math WG is maintaining a set of <see href="https://github.com/mathml-refresh/mathml-polyfills">MathML polyfills</see> to facilitate that transition.</para></blockquote>
