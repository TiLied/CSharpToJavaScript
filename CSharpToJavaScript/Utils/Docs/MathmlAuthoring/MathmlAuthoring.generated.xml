This page explains how to write mathematics using the MathML language, which is described with tags and attributes in text format. Just like for HTML or SVG, this text can become very verbose for complex content and so requires <see href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Math_Tools#Authoring_tools">proper authoring tools</see> such as converters from a <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup language</see> or <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</see> equation editors. Many such tools are available and it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list. Instead, this article focuses on common approaches and examples.
