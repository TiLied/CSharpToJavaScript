<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Historically, this element accepted almost all the MathML attributes and it was used to override the default attribute values of its descendants. It was later restricted to only a few relevant styling attributes that were used in existing web pages. Nowadays, these styling attributes are <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Global_attributes">common to all MathML elements</see> and so <c>&amp;lt;mstyle&amp;gt;</c> is really just equivalent to an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mrow"><c>&amp;lt;mrow&amp;gt;</c></see> element. However, <c>&amp;lt;mstyle&amp;gt;</c> may still be relevant for compatibility with MathML implementations outside browsers.</para></blockquote>
