<summary>
The format of audio and video media files is defined in two parts (three if a file has both audio and video in it, of course): the audio and/or video codecs used and the media container format (or file type) used.<br/>In this guide, we&amp;apos;ll look at the container formats used most commonly on the web, covering basics about their specifications as well as their benefits, limitations, and ideal use cases.

<remarks>
<para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> does not use a container at all.<br/>Instead, it streams the encoded audio and video tracks directly from one peer to another using <see cref="MediaStreamTrack."/> objects to represent each track.<br/>See <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs">Codecs used by WebRTC</see> for information about codecs commonly used for making WebRTC calls, as well as browser compatibility information around codec support in WebRTC.</para>
