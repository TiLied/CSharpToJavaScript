<summary>
The <strong><c>decodingInfo()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="MediaCapabilities"/> interface returns a promise that fulfils with information about how well the user agent can decode/display media with a given configuration.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The resolved object contains three boolean properties <c>supported</c>, <c>smooth</c>, and <c>powerefficient</c>, which indicate whether decoding the media described would be supported, and if so, whether decoding would be smooth and power-efficient.</para><para>The method can also be used to test the user agent capabilities for decoding media encoded with a key system, but only when called in the main thread and in a secure context.<br/>If the configuration passed in the <c>configuration.keySystemConfiguration</c> property is supported for decoding the data, the resolved promise also includes a <see cref="MediaKeySystemAccess"/> object that can be used to create a <see cref="MediaKeys"/> object to setup encrypted playback.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>Calling <c>decodingInfo()</c> with this property may result in user-visible effects, such as asking for permission to access one or more system resources.<br/>As such, this function should only be called when the application is ready to create and use a <c>MediaKeys</c> object with the provided configuration.</para></blockquote>

<returns>A <see cref="'Promise'"/> fulfilling with an object containing the following attributes:Browsers will report a supported media configuration as <c>smooth</c> and <c>powerEfficient</c> until stats on this device have been recorded.<br/>All supported audio codecs report <c>powerEfficient</c> as true.</returns>
