<MediaStreamTrackGetConstraints>
<summary>
The <strong><c>getConstraints()</c></strong> method of<br/>the <see cref="MediaStreamTrack"/> interface returns a<br/><see cref="'MediaTrackConstraints'"/> object containing the set of constraints most<br/>recently established for the track using a prior call to<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>. These<br/>constraints indicate values and ranges of values that the website or application has<br/>specified are required or acceptable for the included constrainable properties.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Constraints can be used to ensure that the media meets certain guidelines you prefer.<br/>For example, you may prefer high definition video but require that the frame rate be a<br/>little low to help keep the data rate low enough not overtax the network. Constraints<br/>can also specify ideal and/or acceptable sizes or ranges of sizes. See <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API/Constraints">Capabilities, constraints, and settings</see> for details on how to work with constrainable properties.</para>

</remarks>
<returns>A <see cref="'MediaTrackConstraints'"/> object which indicates the constrainable<br/>properties the website or app most recently set using<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>. The properties<br/>in the returned object are listed in the same order as when they were set, and only<br/>properties specifically set by the site or app are included.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The returned set of constraints doesn&amp;apos;t necessarily describe<br/>the actual state of the media. Even if any of the constraints couldn&amp;apos;t be met, they<br/>are still included in the returned object as originally set by the site&amp;apos;s code. To get<br/>the currently active settings for all constrainable properties, you should instead<br/>call <see cref="MediaStreamTrack.GetSettings"/>.</blockquote></returns>
