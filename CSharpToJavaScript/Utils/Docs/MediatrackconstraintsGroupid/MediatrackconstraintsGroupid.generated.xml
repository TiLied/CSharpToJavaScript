<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackConstraints"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>groupId</c></strong> property is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints#constraindomstring"><c>ConstrainDOMString</c></see><br/>describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the<br/><see cref="MediaTrackSettings.GroupId"/> constrainable property.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.GroupId"/> as returned by a call<br/>to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically this is<br/>unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para>

<value>An object based on <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints#constraindomstring"><c>ConstrainDOMString</c></see> specifying one or more acceptable,<br/>ideal, and/or exact (mandatory) group IDs which are acceptable as the source of media<br/>content.Group IDs are unique for a given origin for the duration of a single browsing session,<br/>and are shared by all media sources that come from the same physical device. For<br/>example, the microphone and speaker on the same headset would share a group ID. This<br/>makes it possible to use the group ID to ensure that the audio and input devices are on<br/>the same headset by retrieving the group ID of the input device and specifying it when<br/>asking for an output device, perhaps.However, the value of the <c>groupId</c> is determined by the source of the<br/>track&amp;apos;s content, and there&amp;apos;s no particular format mandated by the specification<br/>(although some kind of GUID is recommended). That means that a given track will only<br/>return one value for the <c>groupId</c> when you call<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.GetCapabilities"/>, and keep in mind<br/>that this value will change for each browsing session.Because of this, there&amp;apos;s no use for the group ID when calling<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>, since there is only one possible<br/>value, and you can&amp;apos;t use it to ensure the same group is used across multiple browsing<br/>sessions when calling <c>getUserMedia()</c>.</value>
