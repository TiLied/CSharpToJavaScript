<MediaTrackSettingsEchoCancellation>
<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>echoCancellation</c></strong> property is a Boolean value whose value<br/>indicates whether or not echo cancellation is enabled on an audio track. This lets you<br/>determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this<br/>property&amp;apos;s value as described in the<br/><see cref="MediaTrackConstraints.EchoCancellation"/> property you provided when calling<br/>either <see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/> or<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Echo cancellation is a feature which attempts to prevent echo effects on a two-way<br/>audio connection by attempting to reduce or eliminate crosstalk between the user&amp;apos;s<br/>output device and their input device. For example, it might apply a filter that negates<br/>the sound being produced on the speakers from being included in the input track<br/>generated from the microphone.</para><para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.EchoCancellation"/> as returned<br/>by a call to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically<br/>this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para><para>Because <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</see> doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/><br/>will never include this property.</para>
