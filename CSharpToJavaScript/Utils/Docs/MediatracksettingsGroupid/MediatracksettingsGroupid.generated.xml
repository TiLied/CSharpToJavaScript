<MediaTrackSettingsGroupId>
<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>groupId</c></strong> property is a browsing-session unique<br/>string which identifies the group of devices which includes the source<br/>for the <see cref="MediaStreamTrack"/>. This lets you determine what value was selected<br/>to comply with your specified constraints for this property&amp;apos;s value as described in the<br/><see cref="MediaTrackConstraints.GroupId"/> property you provided when calling either<br/><see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.GroupId"/> as returned by a call<br/>to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically this is<br/>unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para><para>Because <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</see> doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/><br/>will never include this property.</para>

</remarks>
<value>A string whose value is a browsing-session unique identifier for a<br/>group of devices which includes the source of the track&amp;apos;s contents. Two devices share<br/>the same group ID if they belong to the same physical hardware device. For example, a<br/>headset has two devices on it: a microphone which can serve as a source for audio tracks<br/>and a speaker which can serve as an output for audio.The group ID is not usable across multiple browsing sessions. However, it can be used<br/>to ensure that audio input and output are both being performed on the same headset, for<br/>example, or to ensure that the built-in camera and microphone on a phone are being used<br/>for video conferencing purposes.The actual value of the string, however, is determined by the source of the track, and<br/>there is no guarantee what form it will take, although the specification does recommend<br/>it be a GUID.Since this property isn&amp;apos;t stable across browsing sessions, its usefulness when calling<br/><see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/> is generally limited to<br/>ensuring that tasks performed during the same browsing session use devices from the same<br/>group (or that they don&amp;apos;t use devices from the same group). There is no situation in<br/>which the groupId is useful when calling <c>applyConstraints()</c>, since the<br/>value can&amp;apos;t be changed.</value>
