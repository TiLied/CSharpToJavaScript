<MediaTrackSettingsLatency>
<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>latency</c></strong> property is a double-precision floating-point<br/>number indicating the estimated latency (specified in seconds) of the<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack"/> as currently configured. This lets you determine what<br/>value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property&amp;apos;s value<br/>as described in the <see cref="MediaTrackConstraints.Latency"/> property you provided<br/>when calling either <see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/> or<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is, of course, an approximation, since latency can vary for many reasons including<br/>CPU, transmission, and storage overhead.</para><para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.Latency"/> as returned by a call<br/>to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically this is<br/>unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para><para>Because <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</see> doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/><br/>will never include this property.</para>
