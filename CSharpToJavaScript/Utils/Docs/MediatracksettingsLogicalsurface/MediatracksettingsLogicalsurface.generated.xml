<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings."/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>logicalSurface</c></strong> property indicates whether or not the<br/>display area being captured is a logical surface. Logical surfaces are those which are<br/>not necessarily entirely onscreen, or may even be off-screen, such as windows&amp;apos; backing<br/>buffers (where only part of the buffer is visible without scrolling the containing<br/>window) and offscreen rendering contexts.

<value>A Boolean value which is <c>true</c> if the video track in the stream of captured<br/>video is taken from a logical display surface.The most common scenario in which a display surface may be a logical one is if the<br/>selected surface contains the entire content area of a window which is too large to<br/>display onscreen at once. Since the window that contains the surface has to be scrolled<br/>to show the rest of the contents, the surface is a logical one.A visible display surface (that is, a surface for which <c>logicalSurface</c><br/>returns <c>false</c>) is the portion of a logical display surface which is<br/>currently visible onscreen.For example, a user agent <strong>may</strong> choose to allow the user to choose whether to<br/>share the entire document (a <c>browser</c> with <c>logicalSurface</c> value<br/>of <c>true</c>), or just the currently visible portion of the document (where the<br/><c>logicalSurface</c> of the <c>browser</c> surface is <c>false</c>).</value>
