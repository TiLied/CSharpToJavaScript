<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>sampleRate</c></strong> property is an integer indicating how many<br/>audio samples per second the <see cref="MediaStreamTrack"/> is currently configured<br/>for. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified<br/>constraints for this property&amp;apos;s value as described in the<br/><see cref="MediaTrackConstraints.SampleRate"/> property you provided when calling<br/>either <see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/> or<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.SampleRate"/> as returned by a<br/>call to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically this<br/>is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para>

</remarks>
<value>An integer value indicating how many samples each second of audio data includes. Common<br/>values include 44,100 (standard CD audio), 48,000 (standard digital audio), 96,000<br/>(commonly used in audio mastering and post-production), and 192,000 (used for<br/>high-resolution audio in professional recording and mastering sessions). However, lower<br/>values are often used to reduce bandwidth requirements; 8,000 samples per second is<br/>adequate for comprehensible albeit imperfect human speech, and both 11,025 FPS and<br/>22,050 FPS are often used for low-bandwidth, reduced quality sound and music.</value>
