<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSettings"/> dictionary's<br/><strong><c>sampleSize</c></strong> property is an integer indicating the linear<br/>sample size (in bits per sample) the <see cref="MediaStreamTrack"/> is currently<br/>configured for. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your<br/>specified constraints for this property&amp;apos;s value as described in the<br/><see cref="MediaTrackConstraints.SampleSize"/> property you provided when calling<br/>either <see cref="MediaDevices.GetUserMedia"/> or<br/><see cref="MediaStreamTrack.ApplyConstraints"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking<br/>the value of <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.SampleSize"/> as returned by a<br/>call to <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/>. However, typically this<br/>is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they&amp;apos;re unfamiliar with.</para>

<value>An integer value indicating how many bits each audio sample is represented by. The most<br/>commonly used sample size for many years now is 16 bits per sample, which was used for<br/>CD audio among others. Other common sample sizes are 8 (for reduced bandwidth<br/>requirements) and 24 (for high-resolution professional audio).Each audio channel on the track requires sampleSize bits.<br/>That means that a given sample actually uses (<c>sampleSize</c>/8)*<see cref="MediaTrackSettings.ChannelCount"/> bytes of data.<br/>For example, 16-bit stereo audio requires (16/8)*2 or 4 bytes per sample.</value>
