<summary>
The <see cref="MediaTrackSupportedConstraints"/> dictionary's <strong><c>autoGainControl</c></strong> property is a read-only Boolean value which is present (and set to <c>true</c>) in the object returned by <see cref="MediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints"/> if and only if the {{Glossary("user agent")}} supports the <strong><c>autoGainControl</c></strong> constraint.<br/>If the constraint isn&amp;apos;t supported, it&amp;apos;s not included in the list, so this value will never be <c>false</c>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>You can access the supported constraints dictionary by calling <c>navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()</c>.</para><para>The <c>autoGainControl</c> constraint indicates whether or not the browser offers the ability to automatically control the gain (volume) on media tracks; this obviously is contingent on whether or not the individual device supports automatic gain control as well; it&amp;apos;s typically a feature provided by microphones.</para>

<value>This property is present in the dictionary (and its value is always <c>true</c>) if the user agent supports the <c>autoGainControl</c> constraint.<br/>If the property isn't present, this property is missing from the supported constraints dictionary, and you'll get <see cref="Undefined"/> if you try to look at its value.</value>
