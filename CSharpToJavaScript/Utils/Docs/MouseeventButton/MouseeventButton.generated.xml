<summary>
The <strong><c>MouseEvent.button</c></strong> read-only property indicates which button was pressed on the mouse to trigger the event.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This property only guarantees to indicate which buttons are pressed during events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple buttons.<br/>As such, it is not reliable for events such as <see cref="Element/mouseenter_event"/>, <see cref="Element/mouseleave_event"/>, <see cref="Element/mouseover_event"/>, <see cref="Element/mouseout_event"/>, or <see cref="Element/mousemove_event"/>.</para><para>Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device so that if an event&amp;apos;s button property is zero, it may not have been caused by the button that is physically leftâ€“most on the pointing device; however, it should behave as if the left button was clicked in the standard button layout.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Do not confuse this property with the <see cref="MouseEvent.Buttons"/> property, which indicates which buttons are pressed for all mouse events types.</para></blockquote>
