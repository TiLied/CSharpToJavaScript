<summary>
The <strong><c>MouseEvent.buttons</c></strong> read-only property indicates which buttons are pressed on the mouse (or other input device) when a mouse event is triggered.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Each button that can be pressed is represented by a given number (see below).<br/>If more than one button is pressed, the button values are added together to produce a new number.<br/>For example, if the secondary (<c>2</c>) and auxiliary (<c>4</c>) buttons are pressed simultaneously, the value is <c>6</c> (i.e., <c>2 + 4</c>).</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Do not confuse this property with the <see cref="MouseEvent.Button."/> property.<br/>The <see cref="MouseEvent.Buttons."/> property indicates the state of buttons pressed during any kind of mouse event,<br/>while the <see cref="MouseEvent.Button."/> property only guarantees the correct value for mouse events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple buttons.</para></blockquote>
