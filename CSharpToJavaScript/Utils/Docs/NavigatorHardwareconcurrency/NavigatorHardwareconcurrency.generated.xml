<value>A number between 1 and the number of logical processors potentially available to the user agent.Modern computers have multiple physical processor cores in their CPU (two or four cores<br/>is typical), but each physical core is also usually able to run more than one thread at<br/>a time using advanced scheduling techniques. So a four-core CPU may offer eight<br/><strong>logical processor cores</strong>, for example. The number of logical processor<br/>cores can be used to measure the number of threads which can effectively be run at once<br/>without them having to context switch.The browser may, however, choose to report a lower number of logical cores in order to<br/>represent more accurately the number of <see cref="Worker"/>s that can run at once, so<br/>don&amp;apos;t treat this as an absolute measurement of the number of cores in the user&amp;apos;s system.</value>
