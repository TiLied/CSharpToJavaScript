The <strong><c>mediaSession</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="Navigator"/><br/>interface returns a <see cref="MediaSession"/><br/>object that can be used to share with the browser metadata and other information about<br/>the current playback state of media being handled by a document.

<remarks>
<para>This<br/>information may, in turn, be shared with the device and/or operating system in order to<br/>a device&amp;apos;s standard media control user experience to describe and control the playback<br/>of the media.</para><para>In addition, the <c>MediaSession</c> interface provides the<br/><see cref="MediaSession.SetActionHandler"/> method, which lets<br/>you receive events when the user engages device controls such as either onscreen or<br/>physical play, pause, seek, and other similar controls. An internet radio app, for<br/>example, can use <c>setActionHandler()</c> to let the media controls on a keyboard<br/>or elsewhere on the user&amp;apos;s device be used to control the app&amp;apos;s media playback.</para>
