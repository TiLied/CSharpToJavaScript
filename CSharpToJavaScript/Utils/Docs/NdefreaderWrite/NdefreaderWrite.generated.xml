<summary>
The <c>write()</c> method of the <see cref="NDEFReader"/> interface attempts to write an NDEF message to a tag and returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that either resolves when a message has been written to the tag or rejects if a hardware or permission error is encountered. This method triggers a permission prompt if the "nfc" permission has not been previously granted.
