<remarks>
<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> This API shouldn&amp;apos;t be used just to have the notification<br/>removed from the screen after a fixed delay since this method will also remove the<br/>notification from any notification tray, preventing users from interacting with it<br/>after it was initially shown. A valid use for this API would be to remove a<br/>notification that is no longer relevant (e.g. the user already read the notification<br/>on the webpage in the case of a messaging app or the following song is already playing<br/>in a music app).</para></blockquote>
