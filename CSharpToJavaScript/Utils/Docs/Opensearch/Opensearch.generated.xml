<summary>
The <strong><see href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch">OpenSearch description format</see></strong> can be used to describe the web interface of a search engine. This allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine. OpenSearch is supported by (at least) Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Chrome. (See <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#reference_material">Reference Material</see> for links to other browsers&amp;apos; documentation.)
