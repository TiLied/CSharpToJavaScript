<summary>
A website can indicate that a particular <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints">Client Hint</see> is critical to the page by including it in a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Critical-CH">Critical-CH</see> HTTP response header (as well as the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-CH">Accept-CH</see> HTTP request header which is needed for all client hints whether critical or not). Doing so will trigger a connection restart if the hint listed in the <c>Critical-CH</c> HTTP response header could have been, but wasn&amp;apos;t, included in the HTTP request initially sent. If the browser does not support that client hint, it is ignored and no connection restart occurs.
