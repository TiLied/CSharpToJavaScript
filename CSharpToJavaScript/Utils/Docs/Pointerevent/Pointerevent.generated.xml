<remarks>
<para>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices (such as a mouse, pen or contact point on a touch-enable surface). The pointer can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on the contact surface such as a screen.</para><para>A pointer&amp;apos;s <strong>hit test</strong> is the process a browser uses to determine the target element for a pointer event. Typically, this is determined by considering the pointer&amp;apos;s location and also the visual layout of elements in a document on screen media.</para><para></para>
