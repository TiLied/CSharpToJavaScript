<PointerEventGetPredictedEvents>
<summary>
The <strong><c>getPredictedEvents()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="PointerEvent"/> interface returns a sequence of <c>PointerEvent</c> instances that are estimated future pointer positions.<br/>How the predicted positions are calculated depends on the user agent, but they are based on past points, current velocity, and trajectory.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Applications can use the predicted events to &amp;quot;draw ahead&amp;quot; to a predicted position which may reduce perceived latency depending on the application&amp;apos;s interpretation of the predicted events and the use case.</para><para>For an illustration of predicted events, see <see href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#figure_predicted">Figure 8 in the specification</see>.</para>
