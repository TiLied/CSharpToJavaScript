<PointerEventIsPrimary>
<summary>
The <strong><c>isPrimary</c></strong> read-only property of the<br/><see cref="PointerEvent."/> interface indicates whether or not the pointer device that<br/>created the event is the <strong>primary</strong> pointer. It returns <c>true</c> if the<br/>pointer that caused the event to be fired is the primary one and returns<br/><c>false</c> otherwise.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>In a multi-pointer scenario (such as a touch screen that supports more than one touch<br/>point), this property is used to identify a <strong>master pointer</strong> among the set of<br/>active pointers for each pointer type. Only a primary pointer will produce<br/><strong>compatibility mouse events</strong>. Authors who desire only single-pointer interaction<br/>can achieve that by ignoring non-primary pointers.</para><para>A pointer is considered primary if the pointer represents a mouse device. A pointer<br/>representing pen input is considered the primary pen input if its<br/><see cref="Element/pointerdown_event."/> event was dispatched when no other active pointers representing<br/>pen input existed. A pointer representing touch input is considered the primary touch<br/>input if its <see cref="Element/pointerdown_event."/> event was dispatched when no other active pointers<br/>representing touch input existed.</para><para>When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers<br/>(one for each <see cref="PointerEvent.PointerType."/>) are considered<br/>primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will<br/>produce pointers that are both considered primary. If there are multiple primary<br/>pointers, these pointers will all produce <strong>compatibility mouse events</strong> (see<br/><see cref="Pointer_events."/> for more information about pointer, mouse and touch<br/>interaction).</para>
