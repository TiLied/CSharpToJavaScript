<ProgressEventLoaded>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ProgressEvent.loaded</c></strong> read-only property is a 64-bit unsigned integer<br/>indicating the size, in bytes, of the data already transmitted or processed. The ratio can be calculated by dividing <c>ProgressEvent.total</c> by the value of this property.<br/>When downloading a resource using HTTP, this only counts the body of the HTTP message, and doesn&amp;apos;t include headers and other overhead.
