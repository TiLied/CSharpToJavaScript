<ReadableStreamCancel>
<summary>
The <strong><c>cancel()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="ReadableStream."/> interface returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves when the stream is canceled.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Cancel is used when you&amp;apos;ve completely finished with the stream and don&amp;apos;t need any more data from it, even if there are chunks enqueued waiting to be read.<br/>That data is lost after cancel is called, and the stream is not readable any more.<br/>To read those chunks still and not completely get rid of the stream, you'd use <see cref="ReadableStreamDefaultController.Close."/>.</para>
