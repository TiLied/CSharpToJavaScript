<ReadableStreamBYOBRequestRespondWithNewView>
<summary>
The <strong><c>respondWithNewView()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="ReadableStreamBYOBRequest"/> interface specifies a new view that the consumer of the associated readable byte stream should write to instead of <see cref="ReadableStreamBYOBRequest.View"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The new view must be a {{jsxref("TypedArray")}} or a {{jsxref("DataView")}} that provides a view onto the same backing memory region as <see cref="ReadableStreamBYOBRequest.View"/>.<br/>After this method is called, the view that was passed into the method will be transferred and no longer modifiable.</para><para>The method is intended for use cases where an underlying byte source needs to transfer a <c>byobRequest.view</c> internally before finishing its response.<br/>For example, the source may transfer the BYOB view to a separate worker thread, and wait for the worker to transfer it back once it has been filled.</para>
