<blockquote><para>This is mainly relevant to <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service workers</see>. If a user submits<br/>a form and a service worker intercepts the request, you could for example call<br/><c>formData()</c> on it to obtain a key-value map, modify some fields, then send<br/>the form onwards to the server (or use it locally).</para></blockquote>
