<ResponseJson>
<summary>
The <strong><c>json()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Response"/> interface takes<br/>a <see cref="Response"/> stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which<br/>resolves with the result of parsing the body text as <see cref="JSON"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Note that despite the method being named <c>json()</c>, the result is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object.</para>
