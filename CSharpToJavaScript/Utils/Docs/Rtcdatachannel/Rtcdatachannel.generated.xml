<summary>
The <strong><c>RTCDataChannel</c></strong> interface represents a network channel which can be used for bidirectional peer-to-peer transfers of arbitrary data. Every data channel is associated with an <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/>, and each peer connection can have up to a theoretical maximum of 65,534 data channels (the actual limit may vary from browser to browser).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>To create a data channel and ask a remote peer to join you, call the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/>'s <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.CreateDataChannel"/> method. The peer being invited to exchange data receives a <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.Datachannel_event"/> event (which has type <see cref="RTCDataChannelEvent"/>) to let it know the data channel has been added to the connection.</para><para><c>RTCDataChannel</c> is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects">transferable object</see>.</para><para></para>
