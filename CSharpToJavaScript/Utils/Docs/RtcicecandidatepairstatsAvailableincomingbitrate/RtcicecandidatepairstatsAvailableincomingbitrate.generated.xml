<RTCIceCandidatePairStatsAvailableIncomingBitrate>
<summary>
The <strong><c>availableIncomingBitrate</c></strong> property of the <see cref="RTCIceCandidatePairStats"/> dictionary indicates the available inbound capacity of the network connection represented by the candidate pair.<br/>The higher the value, the more bandwidth you can assume is available for incoming data.

<para>You can get the outgoing available bitrate from <see cref="RTCIceCandidatePairStats.AvailableOutgoingBitrate"/>.</para>

</remarks>
<value>A number which approximates the amount of available bandwidth for incoming data on the network connection described by the <c>RTCIceCandidatePair</c>.<br/>The value is reported in bits per second and is computed over a 1-second interval.The value returned is calculated by adding up the available bit rate for every <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</see> stream using the connection described by this candidate pair.<br/>The returned value doesn&amp;apos;t take into account overhead introduced by underlying protocols, including IP, UDP, or TCP.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5>The returned value is computed using a method similar—but not identical—to the Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) described in {{RFC(3890, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;6.2&amp;quot;)}}.</blockquote></value>
