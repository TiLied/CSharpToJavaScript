<RTCIceCandidatePairStatsAvailableOutgoingBitrate>
<summary>
The <strong><c>availableOutgoingBitrate</c></strong> property of the <see cref="RTCIceCandidatePairStats"/> dictionary indicates the available outbound capacity of the network connection represented by the candidate pair.<br/>The higher the value, the more bandwidth you can assume is available for outgoing data.

</remarks>
<value>A number which approximates the amount of available bandwidth for outgoing data on the network connection described by the<br/><c>RTCIceCandidatePair</c>.<br/>The value is reported in bits per second and is computed over a 1-second interval.The returned value is <c>undefined</c> in each of the following situations:The value returned is calculated by adding up the available bit rate for every <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</see> stream using the connection described by this candidate pair.<br/>The returned value doesn&amp;apos;t take into account overhead introduced by underlying protocols, including IP, UDP, or TCP.<blockquote>The returned value is computed using a method similar—but not identical—to the Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) described in {{RFC(3890, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;6.2&amp;quot;)}}.</blockquote></value>
