<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The <strong>obsolete</strong> <see cref="RTCIceCandidatePairStats"/><br/>property <strong><c>priority</c></strong> reports the priority of the candidate<br/>pair as an integer value. The higher the value, the more likely the WebRTC<br/>layer is to select the candidate pair when the time comes to establish (or re-establish)<br/>a connection between the two peers.

<value>An integer value indicating the priority of this pair of candidates as compared to<br/>other pairs on the same peer connection. The higher this value, the better the WebRTC<br/>layer thinks this pair of candidates is compared to the others, and the more likely a<br/>pair is to be selected for use.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> This property was removed from the specification as its value<br/>cannot be guaranteed to be accurately represented in a JavaScript number. You can<br/>calculate its value using the algorithm described in {{RFC(5245, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;5.7.2&amp;quot;)}} if<br/>you need this information and can accept the risk that the result may not be entirely<br/>accurate.</blockquote></value>
