<value>An integer value indicating the priority of this pair of candidates as compared to other pairs on the same peer connection.<br/>The higher this value, the better the WebRTC layer thinks this pair of candidates is compared to the others, and the more likely a pair is to be selected for use.<blockquote>This property was removed from the specification as its value cannot be guaranteed to be accurately represented in a JavaScript number.<br/>You can calculate its value using the algorithm described in {{RFC(5245, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;5.7.2&amp;quot;)}} if you need this information and can accept the risk that the result may not be entirely accurate.</blockquote></value>
