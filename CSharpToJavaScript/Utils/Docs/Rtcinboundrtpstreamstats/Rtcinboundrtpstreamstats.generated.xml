<summary>
The <strong><c>RTCInboundRtpStreamStats</c></strong> dictionary of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC API</see> is used to report statistics related to the receiving end of an RTP stream on the local end of the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The statistics can be obtained by iterating the <see cref="RTCStatsReport"/> returned by <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.GetStats"/> or <see cref="RTCRtpReceiver.GetStats"/> until you find a report with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/type"><c>type</c></see> of <c>inbound-rtp</c>.</para>

<summary>
The <strong><c>averageRtcpInterval</c></strong> property<br/>of the <see cref="RTCInboundRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary is a floating-point value<br/>indicating the average <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP">RTCP</see> transmission interval, in seconds.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The RTCP interval is the amount of time that should elapse between transmissions of RTCP<br/>packets.</para>
<para><seealso href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/averageRtcpInterval"> <em>See also on MDN</em> </seealso></para>
</remarks>
<value>A floating-point value indicating the average interval, in seconds, between<br/>transmissions of RTCP packets. This interval is computed following the formula outlined<br/>in {{RFC(1889, "A.7")}}.Because the interval&amp;apos;s value is determined in part by the number of active senders, it<br/>will be different for each user of a service. Since this value is also used to determine<br/>the number of seconds after a stream starts to flow before the first RTCP packet should<br/>be sent, the result is that if many users try to start using the service at the same<br/>time, the server won&amp;apos;t be flooded with RTCP packets coming in all at once.The sending endpoint computes this value when sending compound RTCP packets, which must<br/>contain at least an RTCP RR or SR packet and an SDES packet with the CNAME item.</value>
