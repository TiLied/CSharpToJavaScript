<summary>
The <strong><c>fecPacketsReceived</c></strong> property<br/>of the <see cref="RTCInboundRtpStreamStats."/> dictionary indicates how many<br/>Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets have been received by this RTP receiver<br/>from the remote peer.

</remarks>
<value>An unsigned integer value which indicates the total number of FEC packets which have<br/>been received from the remote peer during this RTP session. Forward Error Correction<br/>uses an exclusive-or method to perform parity checks on the received data.By using the FEC parity information to attempt to reconstruct damaged packets, it is<br/>possible to avoid the need to retransmit damaged packets, which in turn helps to<br/>reduce lag, or the need to skip damaged frames entirely.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> This counter may also be incremented when FEC packets arrive<br/>in-band along with media content; this can happen with Opus, for example.</blockquote></value>
