The <strong><c>averageRtcpInterval</c></strong> property<br/>of the <see cref="RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary is a floating-point value<br/>indicating the average time that should pass between transmissions of<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP">RTCP</see> packets on this stream.

<value>A floating-point value indicating the average interval, in seconds, between<br/>transmissions of RTCP packets. This interval is computed following the formula outlined<br/>in {{RFC(1889, "A.7")}}.Because the interval&amp;apos;s value is determined in part by the number of active senders, it<br/>will be different for each user of a service. Since this value is also used to determine<br/>the number of seconds after a stream starts to flow before the first RTCP packet should<br/>be sent, the result is that if many users try to start using the service at the same<br/>time, the server won&amp;apos;t be flooded with RTCP packets coming in all at once.The sending endpoint computes this value when sending compound RTCP packets, which must<br/>contain at least an RTCP RR or SR packet and an SDES packet with the CNAME item.</value>
