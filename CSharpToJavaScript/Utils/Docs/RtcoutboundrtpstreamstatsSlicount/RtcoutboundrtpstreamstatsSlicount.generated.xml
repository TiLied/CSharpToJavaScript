<RTCOutboundRtpStreamStatsSliCount>
<summary>
The <strong><c>sliCount</c></strong> property of the<br/><see cref="RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary indicates how many <strong>Slice</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Loss Indication</strong> (<strong>SLI</strong>) packets the<br/><see cref="RTCRtpSender"/> received from the remote <see cref="RTCRtpReceiver"/> for<br/>the RTP stream described by this object.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>An SLI packet is used by a decoder to let the encoder (the sender) know that it&amp;apos;s<br/>detected corruption of one or more consecutive macroblocks, in scan order, in the<br/>received media. In general, what&amp;apos;s usually of interest is that the higher this number is,<br/>the more the stream data is becoming corrupted between the sender and the receiver,<br/>causing the receiver to request retransmits or to drop frames entirely.</para>

</remarks>
<value>An unsigned integer indicating the number of SLI packets the sender received from the<br/>receiver due to lost runs of macroblocks. A high value of <c>sliCount</c> may be<br/>an indication of an unreliable network.This is a very technical part of how video codecs work.
