<summary>
The <strong><c>canTrickleIceCandidates</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/> interface returns a boolean value which indicates whether or not the remote peer can accept <see href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice">trickled ICE candidates</see>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para><strong>ICE trickling</strong> is the process of continuing to send candidates after the initial offer or answer has already been sent to the other peer.</para><para>This property is only set after having called <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.SetRemoteDescription"/>. Ideally, your signaling protocol provides a way to detect trickling support, so that you don't need to rely on this property.<br/>A WebRTC browser will always support trickle ICE. If trickling isn't supported, or you aren't able to tell, you can check for a falsy value for this property and then wait until the value of <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.IceGatheringState"/> changes to <c>&amp;quot;completed&amp;quot;</c> before creating and sending the initial offer.<br/>That way, the offer contains all of the candidates.</para>
