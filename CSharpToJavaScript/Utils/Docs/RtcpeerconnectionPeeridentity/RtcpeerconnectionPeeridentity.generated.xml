<summary>
The <strong><c>peerIdentity</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/> interface returns a JavaScript {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to an <see cref="RTCIdentityAssertion"/> which contains a string identifying the remote peer.<br/>Once this promise resolves successfully, the resulting identity is the <strong>target peer identity</strong> and cannot change for the duration of the connection.

<value>A JavaScript {{jsxref("Promise")}} which resolves to an <see cref="RTCIdentityAssertion"/> that describes the remote peer's identity.If an error occurs while attempting to validate an incoming identity assertion (that is, the information describing a peer&amp;apos;s identity), the promise is rejected.<br/>If there isn&amp;apos;t already a target peer identity, <c>peerIdentity</c> is set to a newly created promise and the process begins again, until the process succeeds or no further attempts to authenticate occur.<blockquote>The promise returned by <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.SetRemoteDescription"/> cannot resolve until any target peer identity that's been set is validated.<br/>If the identity hasn&amp;apos;t been validated yet, the promise returned by <c>setRemoteDescription()</c> will be rejected.<br/>If there&amp;apos;s no target peer identity, <c>setRemoteDescription()</c> doesn&amp;apos;t need to wait for validation to occur before it resolves.</blockquote></value>
