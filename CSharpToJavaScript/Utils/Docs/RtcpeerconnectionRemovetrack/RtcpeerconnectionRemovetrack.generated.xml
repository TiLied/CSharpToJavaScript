<RTCPeerConnectionRemoveTrack>
<summary>
The <strong><c>removeTrack()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection."/> interface tells the local end of the connection to stop sending media from the specified track, without actually removing the corresponding <see cref="RTCRtpSender."/> from the list of senders as reported by <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.GetSenders."/>.<br/>If the track is already stopped, or is not in the connection&amp;apos;s senders list, this method has no effect.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the connection has already been negotiated (<see cref="RTCPeerConnection.SignalingState."/> is set to <c>&amp;quot;stable&amp;quot;</c>), it is marked as needing to be negotiated again; the remote peer won&amp;apos;t experience the change until this negotiation occurs.<br/>A <see cref="RTCPeerConnection/negotiationneeded_event."/> event is sent to the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection."/> to let the local end know this negotiation must occur.</para>
