<RTCPeerConnectionSetLocalDescription>
<summary>
The <strong><c>setLocalDescription()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/> interface changes the local description associated with the connection.<br/>This description specifies the properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format.<br/>The method takes a single parameter—the session description—and it returns a <see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the description has been changed, asynchronously.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If <c>setLocalDescription()</c> is called while a connection is already in place, it means renegotiation is underway (possibly to adapt to changing network conditions).<br/>Because descriptions will be exchanged until the two peers agree on a configuration, the description submitted by calling <c>setLocalDescription()</c> does not immediately take effect.<br/>Instead, the current connection configuration remains in place until negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon configuration take effect.</para>

</remarks>
<returns>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is fulfilled once the value of <see cref="RTCPeerConnection.LocalDescription"/> is successfully changed or rejected if the change cannot be applied (for example, if the specified description is incompatible with one or both of the peers on the connection).<br/>The promise&amp;apos;s fulfillment handler receives no input parameters.<blockquote>The process of changing descriptions actually involves intermediary steps handled by the WebRTC layer to ensure that an active connection can be changed without losing the connection if the change does not succeed.<br/>See <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#pending_and_current_descriptions">Pending and current descriptions</see> in the WebRTC Connectivity page for more details on this process.</blockquote></returns>
