<RTCPeerConnectionSetLocalDescription>
<summary>
The <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/> method<br/><see cref="RTCPeerConnection.SetLocalDescription"/> changes<br/>the local description associated with the connection. This description specifies the<br/>properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format.<br/>The method takes a single parameter—the session description—and it returns a<br/><see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the description has been changed,<br/>asynchronously.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If <c>setLocalDescription()</c> is called while a connection is already in place,<br/>it means renegotiation is underway (possibly to adapt to changing network conditions).<br/>Because descriptions will be exchanged until the two peers agree on a configuration, the<br/>description submitted by calling <c>setLocalDescription()</c> does not immediately<br/>take effect. Instead, the current connection configuration remains in place until<br/>negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon configuration take effect.</para>

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the value of<br/><see cref="RTCPeerConnection.LocalDescription"/> is successfully changed or rejected if<br/>the change cannot be applied (for example, if the specified description is incompatible<br/>with one or both of the peers on the connection). The promise&amp;apos;s fulfillment handler<br/>receives no input parameters.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The process of changing descriptions actually involves intermediary steps handled by<br/>the WebRTC layer to ensure that an active connection can be changed without losing the<br/>connection if the change does not succeed. See<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#pending_and_current_descriptions">Pending and current descriptions</see> in the WebRTC Connectivity page for more details on this process.</blockquote></returns>
