<RTCPeerConnectionSetRemoteDescription>
<summary>
The <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/><br/>method <strong><c>setRemoteDescription()</c></strong> sets the specified<br/>session description as the remote peer&amp;apos;s current offer or answer. The description<br/>specifies the properties of the remote end of the connection, including the media<br/>format. The method takes a single parameter—the session description—and it<br/>returns a <see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the description has been<br/>changed, asynchronously.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is typically called after receiving an offer or answer from another peer over the<br/>signaling server. Keep in mind that if <c>setRemoteDescription()</c> is called<br/>while a connection is already in place, it means renegotiation is underway (possibly<br/>to adapt to changing network conditions).</para><para>Because descriptions will be exchanged until the two peers agree on a configuration,<br/>the description submitted by calling <c>setRemoteDescription()</c> does not<br/>immediately take effect. Instead, the current connection configuration remains in<br/>place until negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon configuration take<br/>effect.</para>

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> which is fulfilled once the value of the connection's<br/><see cref="RTCPeerConnection.RemoteDescription"/> is<br/>successfully changed or rejected if the change cannot be applied (for example, if the<br/>specified description is incompatible with one or both of the peers on the<br/>connection). The promise fulfillment handler receives no input parameters.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The process of changing descriptions actually involves<br/>intermediary steps handled by the WebRTC layer to ensure that an active connection<br/>can be changed without losing the connection if the change does not succeed. See<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#pending_and_current_descriptions">Pending and current descriptions</see> in the WebRTC Connectivity page for more details on this process.</blockquote></returns>
