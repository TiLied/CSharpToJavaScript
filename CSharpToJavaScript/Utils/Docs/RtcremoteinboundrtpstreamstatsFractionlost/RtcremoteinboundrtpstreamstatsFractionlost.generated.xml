<summary>
The <strong><c>fractionLost</c></strong> property of the <see cref="RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary provides a value that can be used to determine the fraction of packets lost for this <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc">synchronization source (SSRC)</see> in the last reporting interval.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>To convert the value to a percentage, divide it by 256 and multiply by 100.<br/>For example, a value of 20 indicates a 7.8% packet loss.</para><para>Note that the value may not be precisely accurate due to the way that it is calculated, but it does provides a quick and convenient measure of the link quality.</para>

</remarks>
<value>A number giving the fraction packet loss in the last reporting interval, multiplied by 256.<br/>The value is 0 if the calculated packet loss is negative.<blockquote>The value comes from the 8-bit <c>fraction lost</c> field of the last Sender Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR) RTCP packet.<br/>The algorithm for calculating the value is defined in <see href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3550#appendix-A.3">RFC 3550, Appendix A.3: Determining Number of Packets Expected and Lost</see>.</blockquote></value>
