<value>The Synchronization Source (SSRC) is a 32-bit integer uniquely identifying the source of the RTP packets whose statistics are covered by the <see cref="RTCStatsReport"/> object of which this <c>RTCRtpStreamStats</c> object is a component.The manner in which these values are generated is not mandated by the specification, although it does make recommendations.<br/>You should not make any assumptions based on the value of <c>ssrc</c> other than that any two objects with the same <c>ssrc</c> value refer to the same source.<br/>See {{RFC(&amp;quot;3550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;)}} for additional information about <c>ssrc</c>.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> The specification includes an example that generates values for <c>ssrc</c> using MD5.<br/>While not part of the standard, exactly, it is a good mechanism that may be used by some browsers; others may use other methods, such as random number generators.<br/><strong>Do not</strong> rely upon these values meaning anything other than &amp;quot;these objects are associated with the same source.&amp;quot;</blockquote></value>
