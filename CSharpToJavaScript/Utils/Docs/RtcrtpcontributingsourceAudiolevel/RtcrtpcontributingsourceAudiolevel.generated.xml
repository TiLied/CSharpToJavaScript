<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>audioLevel</c></strong><br/>property of the <see cref="RTCRtpContributingSource"/> dictionary contains the audio<br/>level contained in the last RTP packet played from the described source.

<remarks>
<para><c>audioLevel</c> will be the level value defined in [RFC6465] if the RFC 6465 header extension<br/>is present, and otherwise null.</para>

<value>A double-precision floating-point number which indicates the volume level of the audio<br/>in the most recently received RTP packet from the source described by the<br/><c>RTCRtpContributingSource</c>.This value, which is in the range 0.0 to 1.0, is on a linear scale and its value is<br/>defined in dBov, or decibels (overload). This is the amplitude relative to the point at<br/>which clipping of the audio begins to occur. A value of 1.0 represents 0 dBov (maximum<br/>volume), a value of 0.0 represents silence, and a value of 0.5 represents approximately<br/>6 dB SPL (decibels of sound pressure level) change in the sound pressure level from 0<br/>dBov.For both <c>RTCRtpContributingSource</c> and<br/><see cref="RTCRtpSynchronizationSource"/>, the audio level is converted to this form<br/>from the values defined in the specifications corresponding to each type of source.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> <c>audioLevel</c> may be absent from <c>RTCRtpContributingSource</c><br/>objects, which indicates that no volume level was provided by the source; however, it<br/>is <strong>required</strong> and always available on all<br/><c>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</c> objects.</blockquote></value>
