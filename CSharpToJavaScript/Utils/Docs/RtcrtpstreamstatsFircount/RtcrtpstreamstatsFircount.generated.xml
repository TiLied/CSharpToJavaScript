<summary>
The <strong><c>firCount</c></strong> property of the<br/><see cref="RTCRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary indicates the number of <strong>Full Intra</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Request</strong> (<strong>FIR</strong>) packets have been sent by the receiver to<br/>the sender.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is a measure of how often the stream falls behind and has to<br/>skip frames in order to catch up.</para>

</remarks>
<value>An integer value indicating how many FIR packets have been received by the sender<br/>during the current connection. This value is available only on receivers for video<br/>tracks.The receiver sends a FIR packet to the sender any time it falls behind or loses packets<br/>and cannot decode the incoming stream any longer because of the lost data. This tells<br/>the sender to send a full frame instead of a delta frame, so that the receiver can catch<br/>up.The higher <c>firCount</c> is, the more often frames were dropped, which may be<br/>an indication that the media&amp;apos;s bit rate is too high for the available bandwidth, or that<br/>the receiving device is overburdened and is therefore unable to process the incoming<br/>data.</value>
