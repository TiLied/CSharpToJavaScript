<summary>
The <strong><c>pliCount</c></strong> property of the<br/><see cref="RTCRtpStreamStats"/> dictionary states the number of times the stream's<br/>receiving end sent a <strong>Picture Loss Indication</strong> (<strong>PLI</strong>)<br/>packet to the sender.

<remarks>
<para>A PLI packet indicates that some amount of encoded video<br/>data has been lost for one or more frames.</para>

<value>An integer value indicating the number of times a PLI packet was sent by the stream&amp;apos;s<br/>receiver to the sender.A PLI message is used by video decoders (running on the receiving end of the stream) to<br/>notify the encoder (the sender) that an undefined amount of coded video data, which may<br/>span frame boundaries, has been lost.This may trigger the sender to send a full frame in order to allow the receiver to<br/>re-synchronize, since lost data may be an irrecoverable situation for decoding media.<br/>However, the primary purpose of this message is to allow the sender to consider<br/>techniques to mitigate network performance issues. This is often achieved by methods<br/>such as increasing the compression, lowering resolution, or finding other ways to reduce<br/>the bit rate of the stream.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><strong>Note:</strong> This value is only available on the receiver, and only for<br/>video media.</blockquote></value>
