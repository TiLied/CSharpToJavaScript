<RTCRtpTransceiver>
<summary>
The WebRTC interface <strong><c>RTCRtpTransceiver</c></strong> describes a permanent pairing of an <see cref="RTCRtpSender"/> and an <see cref="RTCRtpReceiver"/>, along with some shared state.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Each {{Glossary("SDP")}} media section describes one bidirectional SRTP ("Secure Real Time Protocol") stream (excepting the media section for <see cref="RTCDataChannel"/>, if present). This pairing of send and receive SRTP streams is significant for some applications, so <c>RTCRtpTransceiver</c> is used to represent this pairing, along with other important state from the media section. Each non-disabled SRTP media section is always represented by exactly one transceiver.</para><para>A transceiver is uniquely identified using its <see cref="RTCRtpTransceiver.Mid"/> property, which is the same as the media ID (<c>mid</c>) of its corresponding m-line. An <c>RTCRtpTransceiver</c> is <strong>associated</strong> with an m-line if its <c>mid</c> is non-null; otherwise it&amp;apos;s considered disassociated.</para>
