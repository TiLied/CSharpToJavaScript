<SchedulingIsInputPending>
<summary>
The <strong><c>isInputPending()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Scheduling"/> interface allows you to check whether there are pending input events in the event queue, indicating that the user is attempting to interact with the page.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This feature can be useful in situations where you have a queue of tasks to run, and you want to yield to the main thread regularly to allow user interaction to occur so that the app is kept as responsive and performant as possible. <c>isInputPending()</c> allows you to yield only when there is input pending, rather than having to do it at arbitrary intervals.</para><blockquote><para>The <c>isInputPending()</c> method has been superseded by features available on the <see cref="Scheduler"/> interface such as <see cref="Scheduler.Yield"/>, which are better designed for addressing scheduling tasks. See <see href="https://web.dev/articles/optimize-long-tasks#isinputpending">Don&amp;apos;t use <c>isInputPending()</c></see> for more details.</para></blockquote><para><c>isInputPending()</c> is called using <c>navigator.scheduling.isInputPending()</c>.</para>
