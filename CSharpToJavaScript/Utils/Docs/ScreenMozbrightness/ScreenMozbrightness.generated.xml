<ScreenMozBrightness>
<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> Indicates how bright the screen&amp;apos;s backlight is, on a scale from 0 (very dim) to 1 (full<br/>brightness); this value is a double-precision float.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>You can read and write this attribute even when the screen is disabled, but the<br/>backlight is off while the screen is disabled. If you write a value of X into this<br/>attribute, the attribute may not have the same value X when you later read it. Most<br/>screens don&amp;apos;t support as many different brightness levels as there are doubles between 0<br/>and 1. The value&amp;apos;s precision might be reduced before storing it.</para>
