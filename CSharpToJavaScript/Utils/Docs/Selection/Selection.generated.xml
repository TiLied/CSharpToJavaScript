<Selection>
<summary>
A <strong><c>Selection</c></strong> object represents the range of text selected by the user or the current position of the caret. Each <see cref="Document"/> is associated with a unique selection object, which can be retrieved by <see cref="Document.GetSelection"/> or <see cref="Window.GetSelection"/> and then be examined and modified.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The <strong><strong>anchor</strong></strong> is where the user began the selection and the <strong><strong>focus</strong></strong> is where the user ends the selection. If you make a selection with a desktop mouse, the anchor is placed where you pressed the mouse button, and the focus is placed where you released the mouse button.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Anchor</strong> and <strong>focus</strong> should not be confused with the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> positions of a selection. The anchor can be placed before the focus or vice versa, depending on the direction you made your selection.</para></blockquote>
