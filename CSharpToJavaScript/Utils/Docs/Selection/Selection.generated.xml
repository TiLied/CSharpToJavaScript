<remarks>
<para>A user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The <strong><strong>anchor</strong></strong> is where the user began the selection and the <strong><strong>focus</strong></strong> is where the user ends the selection. If you make a selection with a desktop mouse, the anchor is placed where you pressed the mouse button, and the focus is placed where you released the mouse button.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Anchor</strong> and <strong>focus</strong> should not be confused with the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> positions of a selection. The anchor can be placed before the focus or vice versa, depending on the direction you made your selection.</para></blockquote>
