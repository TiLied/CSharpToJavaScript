<para>A user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left<br/>(reverse of document order). The anchor is where the user began the selection. This can<br/>be visualized by holding the Shift key and pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. The<br/>selection&amp;apos;s anchor does not move, but the selection&amp;apos;s focus, the other end of the<br/>selection, does move.</para>
