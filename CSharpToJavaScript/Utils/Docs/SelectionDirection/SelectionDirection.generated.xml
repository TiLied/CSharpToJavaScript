<remarks>
<para>The value is determined by the order in which the user chooses the boundary points of the selection.<br/>For example, a user might make a selection by clicking a starting boundary point, dragging the cursor, and releasing at an end boundary point.<br/>If the end boundary point is later in the document than the start point, then the direction is &amp;quot;forwards&amp;quot;, while the direction is &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; if the end point is before the start point within the document.<br/>The value is &amp;quot;directionless&amp;quot; if no direction is implied by the user. For example, if the user made the selection by double-clicking on a word or element, or the selection was made programmatically.</para><para>The direction does not change if a selection's range is mutated, for example, using methods like <see cref="Range.SelectNode"/>.</para>
