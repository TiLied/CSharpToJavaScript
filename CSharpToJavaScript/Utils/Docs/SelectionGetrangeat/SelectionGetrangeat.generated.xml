<SelectionGetRangeAt>
<summary>
The <strong><c>getRangeAt()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="Selection"/> interface returns a range object representing a currently selected range.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the endpoints of the selected range are within a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/shadow tree">shadow tree</see> then JavaScript does not have visibility of the shadow nodes, and the method should re-scope the range to include the host element that contains the end point.<br/>In practice most browsers do not yet implement this behavior, and the returned range is unpredictable.</para><blockquote><para>When selecting within nodes that might contain a shadow root, you can use <see cref="Selection.GetComposedRanges"/> (if supported) to get a selection range inside a shadow tree, or to reliably re-scope the selection to the host node.</para></blockquote>
