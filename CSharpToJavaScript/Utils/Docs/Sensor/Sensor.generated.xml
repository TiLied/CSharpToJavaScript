<summary>
The <strong><c>Sensor</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sensor_APIs">Sensor APIs</see> is the base class for all the other sensor interfaces. This interface cannot be used directly. Instead it provides properties, event handlers, and methods accessed by interfaces that inherit from it.

Once the <see cref="Sensor.Start"/> method is called, it prepares itself to read data and, once ready, the <see cref="Sensor/activate_event"/> event is sent and the sensor becomes <strong>activated</strong>. It then sends a <see cref="Sensor/reading_event"/> event each time new data is available.</para><para>In case of an error, the <see cref="Sensor/error_event"/> event is sent, reading stops, and the <c>Sensor</c> object becomes <strong>idle</strong> again. The <see cref="Sensor.Start"/> method needs to be called again before it can read further data.</para>
