<summary>
The <strong><c>ServiceWorker</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Worker API</see> provides a reference to a service worker. Multiple <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/browsing context">browsing context</see> (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same service worker, each through a unique <c>ServiceWorker</c> object.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A <c>ServiceWorker</c> object is available in the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Active"/> property, and the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer.Controller"/> property — this is a service worker that has been activated and is controlling the page (the service worker has been successfully registered, and the controlled page has been reloaded.)</para><para>The <c>ServiceWorker</c> interface is dispatched a set of lifecycle events — <c>install</c> and <c>activate</c> — and functional events including <c>fetch</c>. A <c>ServiceWorker</c> object has an associated <see cref="ServiceWorker.State"/>, related to its lifecycle.</para><para>Service workers allow static import of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript modules</see>, if supported, using <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import"><c>import</c></see>.<br/>Dynamic import is disallowed by the specification — calling <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import"><c>import()</c></see> will throw.</para><para></para>
