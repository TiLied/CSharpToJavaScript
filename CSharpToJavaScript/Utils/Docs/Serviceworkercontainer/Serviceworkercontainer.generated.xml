<ServiceWorkerContainer>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ServiceWorkerContainer</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Worker API</see> provides an object representing the service worker as an overall unit in the network ecosystem, including facilities to register, unregister and update service workers, and access the state of service workers and their registrations.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Most importantly, it exposes the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer.Register"/> method used to register service workers, and the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer.Controller"/> property used to determine whether or not the current page is actively controlled.</para><para><c>ServiceWorkerContainer</c> objects are exposed in the Window scope through <see cref="Navigator.ServiceWorker"/> and in workers using <see cref="WorkerNavigator.ServiceWorker"/> (if supported â€” check <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility</see>).</para><para></para>

<ServiceWorkerContainerController>
<summary>
The <strong><c>controller</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface represents the active {{domxref("ServiceWorker","service worker",&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;nocode&amp;quot;)}} controlling the current page (associated with this <c>ServiceWorkerContainer</c>), or <c>null</c> if the page has no active or activating service worker.
</summary>
<remarks>

<ServiceWorkerContainerControllerchange>
<summary>
The <strong><c>controllerchange</c></strong> event of the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface fires when the document's associated <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> acquires a new <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Active"/> worker.

<ServiceWorkerContainerGetRegistration>
<summary>
The <strong><c>getRegistration()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface gets a<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> object whose scope URL matches the provided<br/>client URL. The method returns a <see cref="Promise"/> that resolves to<br/>a <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> or <c>undefined</c>.

The <strong><c>getRegistrations()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface gets all<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/>s associated with a<br/><c>ServiceWorkerContainer</c>, in an array.

<ServiceWorkerContainerMessageerror>
<summary>
The <strong><c>messageerror</c></strong> event is fired to the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> when an incoming message sent to the associated worker can't be deserialized.

<ServiceWorkerContainerReady>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ready</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface provides a way of delaying code execution until a service worker is active.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The property returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that will never reject, and which waits indefinitely until the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> associated with the current page has an <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration.Active"/> worker.<br/>Once that condition is met, it resolves with the <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/>.</para>
<para><seealso href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/ready"> <em>See also on MDN</em> </seealso></para>
</remarks>
<value>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that will never reject, and which may eventually resolve with a <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> when there is an active service worker.</value>
</ServiceWorkerContainerReady>
<ServiceWorkerContainerRegister>
<summary>
The <strong><c>register()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface creates or updates a <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> for the given scope.<br/>If successful, the registration associates the provided script URL to a <strong>scope</strong>, which is subsequently used for matching documents to a specific service worker.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A single registration is created for each unique scope.<br/>If <c>register()</c> is called for a scope that has an existing registration, the registration is updated with any changes to the scriptURL or options.<br/>If there are no changes, then the existing registration is returned.<br/>Note that calling <c>register()</c> with the same scope and <c>scriptURL</c> does not restart the installation process.<br/>You can therefore call this method unconditionally from a controlled page: you don&amp;apos;t need to first check whether there&amp;apos;s an active registration or service worker.</para><para>A document can potentially be within the scope of several registrations with different service workers and options.<br/>The browser will associate the document with the matching registration that has the most specific scope.<br/>This ensures that only one service worker runs for each document.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>It is generally safer not to define registrations that have overlapping scopes.</para></blockquote>

<ServiceWorkerContainerStartMessages>
<summary>
The <strong><c>startMessages()</c></strong> method of<br/>the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface explicitly starts the flow of<br/>messages being dispatched from a service worker to pages under its control (e.g., sent<br/>via <see cref="Client.PostMessage"/>). This can be used to react to sent messages<br/>earlier, even before that page&amp;apos;s content has finished loading.
