<ServiceWorkerContainerRegister>
<summary>
The <strong><c>register()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface creates or updates a <see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> for the given scope.<br/>If successful, the registration associates the provided script URL to a <strong>scope</strong>, which is subsequently used for matching documents to a specific service worker.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A single registration is created for each unique scope.<br/>If <c>register()</c> is called for a scope that has an existing registration, the registration is updated with any changes to the scriptURL or options.<br/>If there are no changes, then the existing registration is returned.<br/>Note that calling <c>register()</c> with the same scope and <c>scriptURL</c> does not restart the installation process.<br/>You can therefore call this method unconditionally from a controlled page: you don&amp;apos;t need to first check whether there&amp;apos;s an active registration or service worker.</para><para>A document can potentially be within the scope of several registrations with different service workers and options.<br/>The browser will associate the document with the matching registration that has the most specific scope.<br/>This ensures that only one service worker runs for each document.</para><blockquote><para>It is generally safer not to define registrations that have overlapping scopes.</para></blockquote>
