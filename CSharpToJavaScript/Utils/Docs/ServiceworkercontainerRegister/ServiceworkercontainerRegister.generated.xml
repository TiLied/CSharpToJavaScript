<ServiceWorkerContainerRegister>
<summary>
The <strong><c>register()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerContainer"/> interface creates or updates a<br/><see cref="ServiceWorkerRegistration"/> for the given <c>scriptURL</c>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If successful, a service worker registration ties the provided script URL to a<br/><strong>scope</strong>, which is subsequently used for navigation matching. You can call this<br/>method unconditionally from the controlled page. I.e., you don&amp;apos;t need to first check<br/>whether there&amp;apos;s an active registration.</para><para>There is frequent confusion surrounding the meaning and use of <strong>scope</strong>. Since a<br/>service worker can&amp;apos;t have a scope broader than its own location, only use the<br/><c>scope</c> option when you need a scope that is narrower than the default.</para>
