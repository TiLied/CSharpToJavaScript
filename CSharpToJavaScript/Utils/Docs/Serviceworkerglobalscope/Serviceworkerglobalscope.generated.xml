<ServiceWorkerGlobalScope>
<summary>
The <strong><c>ServiceWorkerGlobalScope</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Worker API</see> represents the global execution context of a service worker.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Developers should keep in mind that the ServiceWorker state is not persisted across the termination/restart cycle, so each event handler should assume it&amp;apos;s being invoked with a bare, default global state.</para><para>Once successfully registered, a service worker can and will be terminated when idle to conserve memory and processor power. An active service worker is automatically restarted to respond to events, such as <see cref="ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.Fetch_event"/> or <see cref="ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.Message_event"/>.</para><para>Additionally, synchronous requests are not allowed from within a service worker — only asynchronous requests, like those initiated via the <see cref="Fetch"/> method, can be used.</para><para>This interface inherits from the <see cref="WorkerGlobalScope"/> interface, and its parent <see cref="EventTarget"/>.</para><para></para>
