<summary>
The <strong><c>localService</c></strong> read-only property of the<br/><see cref="SpeechSynthesisVoice"/> interface returns a boolean value<br/>indicating whether the voice is supplied by a local speech synthesizer service<br/>(<c>true</c>), or a remote speech synthesizer service (<c>false</c>.)
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This property is provided to allow differentiation in the case that some voice options<br/>are provided by a remote service; it is possible that remote voices might have extra<br/>latency, bandwidth or cost associated with them, so such distinction may be useful.</para>
