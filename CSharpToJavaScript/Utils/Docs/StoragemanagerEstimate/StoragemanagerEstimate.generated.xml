<summary>
The <strong><c>estimate()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="StorageManager"/> interface asks the Storage Manager for how much storage the current <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy">origin</see> takes up (<c>usage</c>), and how much space is available (<c>quota</c>).
