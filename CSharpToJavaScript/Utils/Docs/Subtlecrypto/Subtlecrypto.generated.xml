<summary>
The <strong><c>SubtleCrypto</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</see> provides a number of low-level cryptographic functions.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The interface name includes the term &amp;quot;subtle&amp;quot; to indicate that many of its algorithms have subtle usage requirements, and hence that it must be used carefully in order to provide suitable security guarantees.</para><para>An instance of <c>SubtleCrypto</c> is available as the <see cref="Crypto.Subtle"/> property of the <see cref="Crypto"/> interface, which in turn is available in windows through the <see cref="Window.Crypto"/> property and in workers through the <see cref="WorkerGlobalScope.Crypto"/> property.</para><blockquote><para>This API provides a number of low-level cryptographic primitives. It&amp;apos;s very easy to misuse them, and the pitfalls involved can be very subtle.</para><para>Even assuming you use the basic cryptographic functions correctly, secure key management and overall security system design are extremely hard to get right, and are generally the domain of specialist security experts.</para><para>Errors in security system design and implementation can make the security of the system completely ineffective.</para><para>Please learn and experiment, but don&amp;apos;t guarantee or imply the security of your work before an individual knowledgeable in this subject matter thoroughly reviews it. The <see href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101 Course</see> can be a great place to start learning about the design and implementation of secure systems.</para></blockquote>
