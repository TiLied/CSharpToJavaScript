<summary>
The <strong><c>SubtleCrypto</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</see> provides a number of low-level cryptographic functions. Access to the features of <c>SubtleCrypto</c> is obtained through the <see cref="Crypto.Subtle"/> property of the <see cref="Crypto"/> object you get from the <see cref="Crypto_property"/> property.

<blockquote class="WARNING"><h5>WARNING</h5><para><strong>Warning:</strong> This API provides a number of low-level cryptographic primitives. It&amp;apos;s very easy to misuse them, and the pitfalls involved can be very subtle.</para><para>Even assuming you use the basic cryptographic functions correctly, secure key management and overall security system design are extremely hard to get right, and are generally the domain of specialist security experts.</para><para>Errors in security system design and implementation can make the security of the system completely ineffective.</para><para>Please learn and experiment, but don&amp;apos;t guarantee or imply the security of your work before an individual knowledgeable in this subject matter thoroughly reviews it. The <see href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101 Course</see> can be a great place to start learning about the design and implementation of secure systems.</para></blockquote>
