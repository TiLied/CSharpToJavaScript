<SVGAttributeDecoding>
<summary>
The <c>decoding</c> attribute, valid on <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElementimage">image</see> elements, provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding along with rendering other content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct" (<c>sync</c>), or render and present the other content first and then decode the image and present it later (<c>async</c>). In practice, <c>async</c> means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.

<remarks>
<para>It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using <c>decoding</c> on static <c>&amp;lt;image&amp;gt;</c> elements. They&amp;apos;ll likely be initially rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either from the network or from the cache) and then handled independently anyway, so the &amp;quot;syncing&amp;quot; of content updates is less apparent. However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while often quite small, <strong>can</strong> be measured — even if it is difficult to observe with the human eye.</para><para>Using different <c>decoding</c> types can result in more noticeable differences when dynamically inserting <c>&amp;lt;image&amp;gt;</c> elements into the DOM via JavaScript — see <see cref="SVGImageElement.Decoding."/> for more details.</para><para>Allowed values:</para>
