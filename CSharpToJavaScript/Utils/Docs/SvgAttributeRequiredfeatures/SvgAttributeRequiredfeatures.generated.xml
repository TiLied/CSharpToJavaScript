<SVGAttributeRequiredFeatures>
<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The <strong><c>requiredFeatures</c></strong> attribute takes a list of feature strings, with the individual strings separated by white space. It determines whether or not all of the named features are supported by the browser; if all of them are supported, the attribute evaluates to <c>true</c> end the element is rendered; otherwise, the attribute evaluates to <c>false</c> and the current element and its children are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features aren&amp;apos;t available.

<remarks>

If a null string or empty string value is given to attribute <c>requiredFeatures</c>, the attribute is evaluate to <c>false</c>.</para><para><c>requiredFeatures</c> is often used in conjunction with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElementswitch">switch</see> element.
