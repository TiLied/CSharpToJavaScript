<SVGElementDefs>
<summary>
The <strong><c>&amp;lt;defs&amp;gt;</c></strong> element is used to store graphical objects that will be used at a later time. Objects created inside a <c>&amp;lt;defs&amp;gt;</c> element are not rendered directly. To display them you have to reference them (with a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElementuse">use</see> element for example).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Graphical objects can be referenced from anywhere, however, defining these objects inside of a <c>&amp;lt;defs&amp;gt;</c> element promotes understandability of the SVG content and is beneficial to the overall accessibility of the document.</para>
