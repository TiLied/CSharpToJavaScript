<summary>
Perhaps more exciting than just fills and strokes is the fact that you can also create and apply gradients as either fills or strokes.

<remarks>
<para>There are two types of SVG gradients: linear and radial. They are defined separately from where they are used, which promotes reusability. You <strong>must</strong> give each gradient an <c>id</c> attribute to allow other elements to reference it. Gradient definitions can be placed in a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElement'defs'">'defs'</see> element or an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElement'svg'">'svg'</see> element.</para>
