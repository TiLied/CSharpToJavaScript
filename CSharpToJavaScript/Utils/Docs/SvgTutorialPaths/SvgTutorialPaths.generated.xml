Paths create complex shapes by combining multiple straight lines or curved lines. Complex shapes composed only of straight lines can be created as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes#polyline"><c>&amp;lt;polyline&amp;gt;</c>s</see>. While <c>&amp;lt;polyline&amp;gt;</c>s and <c>&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;</c>s can create similar-looking shapes, <c>&amp;lt;polyline&amp;gt;</c>s require a lot of small straight lines to simulate curves, and don&amp;apos;t scale well to larger sizes.

<remarks>
<para>A good understanding of paths is important when drawing SVGs. While creating complex paths using an XML editor or text editor is not recommended, understanding how they work will allow to identify and repair display issues in SVGs.</para><para>The shape of a <c>&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;</c> element is defined by one parameter: d. (See more in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes">basic shapes</see>.) The <c>d</c> attribute contains a series of commands and parameters used by those commands.</para><para>Each of the commands is instantiated (for example, creating a class, naming and locating it) by a specific letter. For instance, let&amp;apos;s move to the x and y coordinates (<c>10</c>, <c>10</c>). The &amp;quot;Move to&amp;quot; command is called with the letter <c>M</c>. When the parser runs into this letter, it knows it needs to move to a point. So, to move to (<c>10</c>, <c>10</c>) the command to use would be <c>M 10 10</c>. After that, the parser begins reading for the next command.</para><para>All of the commands also come in two variants. An <strong>uppercase letter</strong> specifies absolute coordinates on the page, and a <strong>lowercase letter</strong> specifies relative coordinates (e.g., <strong>move 10px up and 7px to the left from the last point</strong>).</para><para>Coordinates in the <c>d</c> parameter are <strong>always unitless</strong> and hence in the user coordinate system. Later, we will learn how paths can be transformed to suit other needs.</para>
