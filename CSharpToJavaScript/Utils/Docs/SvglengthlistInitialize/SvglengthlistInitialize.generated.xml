<SVGLengthListInitialize>
<summary>
The <strong><c>initialize()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="SVGLengthList"/> interface clears all existing items from the list and re-initializes the list to hold the single item specified by the parameter. If the inserted item is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy. The return value is the item inserted into the list.
