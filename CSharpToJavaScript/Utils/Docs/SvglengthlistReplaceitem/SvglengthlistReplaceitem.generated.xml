<SVGLengthListReplaceItem>
<summary>
The <strong><c>replaceItem()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="SVGLengthList"/> interface replaces an existing item in the list with a new item. If the new item is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy. If the item is already in this list, note that the index of the item to replace is before the removal of the item.
