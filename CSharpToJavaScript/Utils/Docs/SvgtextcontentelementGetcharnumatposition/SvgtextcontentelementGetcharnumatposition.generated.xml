The <c>getCharNumAtPosition()</c> method of the <see cref="SVGTextContentElement"/> interface represents the character which caused a text glyph to be rendered at a given position in the coordinate system. Because the relationship between characters and glyphs is not one-to-one, only the first character of the relevant typographic character is returned.
