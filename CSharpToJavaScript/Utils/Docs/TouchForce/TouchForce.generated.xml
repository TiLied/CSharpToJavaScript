<value>A <c>float</c> that represents the amount of pressure the user is applying to the<br/>touch surface. This is a value between <c>0.0</c> (no pressure) and<br/><c>1.0</c> (the maximum amount of pressure the hardware can recognize). A value of<br/><c>0.0</c> is returned if no value is known (for example the touch device does not<br/>support this property). In environments where force is known, the absolute pressure<br/>represented by the force attribute, and the sensitivity in levels of pressure, may vary.</value>
