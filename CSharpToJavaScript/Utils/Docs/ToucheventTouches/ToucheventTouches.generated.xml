<TouchEventTouches>
<summary>
<strong><c>touches</c></strong> is a read-only <see cref="TouchList"/> listing<br/>all the <see cref="Touch"/> objects for touch points that are currently in contact<br/>with the touch surface, regardless of whether or not they&amp;apos;ve changed or what their<br/>target element was at <see cref="Element/touchstart_event"/> time.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>You can think of it as how many separate fingers are able to be identified as touching<br/>the screen.</para><blockquote><para>Touches inside the array are not necessarily ordered by order of occurrences (the<br/>i-th element in the array being the i-th touch that happened). You cannot assume a specific order. To determine the order of occurrences of the touches, use the <c>touch</c> object IDs.</para></blockquote>
