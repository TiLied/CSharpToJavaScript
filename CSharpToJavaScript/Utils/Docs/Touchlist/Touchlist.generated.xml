<TouchList>
<summary>
The <strong><c>TouchList</c></strong> interface represents a list of contact points on a touch surface. For example, if the user has three fingers on the touch surface (such as a screen or trackpad), the corresponding <c>TouchList</c> object would have one <see cref="Touch."/> object for each finger, for a total of three entries.

Modern APIs use types that wrap around ECMAScript array types instead, so you can treat them like ECMAScript arrays, and at the same time impose additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items read-only).</para></blockquote>
