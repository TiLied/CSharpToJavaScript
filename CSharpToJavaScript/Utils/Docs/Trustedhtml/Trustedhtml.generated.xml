<summary>
The <strong><c>TrustedHTML</c></strong> interface of the <see cref="'Trusted Types API'"/> represents a string that a developer can insert into an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#injection_sinks">injection sink</see> that will render it as HTML. These objects are created via <see cref="TrustedTypePolicy.CreateHTML"/> and therefore have no constructor.
