<TrustedScript>
<summary>
The <strong><c>TrustedScript</c></strong> interface of the <see cref="'Trusted Types API'"/> represents a string with an uncompiled script body that a developer can insert into an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#injection_sinks">injection sink</see> that might execute the script. These objects are created via <see cref="TrustedTypePolicy.CreateScript"/> and therefore have no constructor.

<remarks>
<para>The value of a <strong>TrustedScript</strong> object is set when the object is created and cannot be changed by JavaScript as there is no setter exposed.</para>
