<UIEventSourceCapabilities>
<summary>
The <strong><c>sourceCapabilities</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="UIEvent"/> interface returns<br/>an instance of the <see cref="'InputDeviceCapabilities'"/> interface which provides<br/>information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event. If no<br/>input device was responsible for the event, it returns <c>null</c>.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of different<br/>input events, the <c>sourceCapabilities</c> property for all of them will point to<br/>the same instance of <c>InputDeviceCapabilities</c>. For example, when a user<br/>lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several UIEvents may be generated including<br/><c>touchend</c>, <c>mousedown</c>, <c>click</c>, and<br/><c>focus</c>. All of these events must have the same<br/><c>sourceCapabilities</c> representing the touchscreen.</para><para>A device is considered &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot; for an event only when that interaction is part of<br/>the abstraction provided by the web platform. For example, many user agents allow a<br/>window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard, but this detail is not exposed to the<br/>web platform in any way, and so the sourceCapabilities of a resize event will typically<br/>be null.</para>
