<Vibration_API>
<summary>
Most modern mobile devices include vibration hardware, which lets software code provide physical feedback to the user by causing the device to shake. The <strong>Vibration API</strong> offers Web apps the ability to access this hardware, if it exists, and does nothing if the device doesn&amp;apos;t support it.
