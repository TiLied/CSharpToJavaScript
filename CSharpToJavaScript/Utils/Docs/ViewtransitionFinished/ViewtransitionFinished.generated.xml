<ViewTransitionFinished>
<summary>
The <strong><c>finished</c></strong> read-only property of the<br/><see cref="ViewTransition"/> interface is a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fulfills once the transition animation is finished, and the new page view is visible and interactive to the user.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para><c>finished</c> will only reject in the case of a same-document (SPA) transition, if the callback passed to <see cref="Document.StartViewTransition"/> throws or returns a promise that rejects. This would indicate that the new state of the page wasn't created.</para><para>If a transition animation fails to start or is skipped during the transition using <see cref="ViewTransition.SkipTransition"/>, the end state is still reached therefore <c>finished</c> will still fulfill.</para>
