<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The <strong><c>position</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="VRPose"/> interface returns the position of the <see cref="VRDisplay"/> at the current timestamp as a 3D vector.
</summary>
<remarks>
<blockquote><para>This property was part of the old <see href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/">WebVR API</see>. It has been superseded by the <see href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR Device API</see>.</para></blockquote><para>The coordinate system is as follows:</para><para>Positions are measured in meters from an origin point — this point is either the position the sensor was first read at, or the position of the sensor at the point that <see cref="VRDisplay.ResetPose"/> was last called.</para><blockquote><para>By default, all positions are given as a sitting space position. Transforming this point with <see cref="VRStageParameters.SittingToStandingTransform"/> — when you are working with a room display for example — converts this to a standing space position.</para></blockquote>
