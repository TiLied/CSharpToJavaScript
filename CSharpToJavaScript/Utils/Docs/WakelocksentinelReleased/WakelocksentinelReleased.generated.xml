<WakeLockSentinelReleased>
<summary>
The <strong><c>released</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> interface returns a boolean that indicates whether a <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> has been released.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The <c>WakeLockSentinel</c> is released when the associated platform screen wake lock is revoked; afterwards <c>released</c> will always return <c>true</c>.<br/>If a subsequent screen wake lock is required, the application will need to request a new screen wake lock (the current <c>WakeLockSentinel</c> cannot be reused).</para>

</remarks>
<value>A boolean value that is <c>false</c> until the <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> has been released (either through a call to <see cref="WakeLockSentinel.Release"/> or because the lock has been released automatically) and the <see cref="WakeLockSentinel/release_event"/> event has been emitted, after which it becomes <c>true</c> and no longer changes.</value>
