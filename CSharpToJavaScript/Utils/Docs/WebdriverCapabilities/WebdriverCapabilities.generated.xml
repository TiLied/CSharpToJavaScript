<summary>
WebDriver <strong><strong>capabilities</strong></strong> are used to communicate the features supported by a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver">session</see>. A client may also use capabilities to define which features it requires the driver to satisfy when <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands/NewSession">creating a new session</see>.
</summary>
<remarks>
