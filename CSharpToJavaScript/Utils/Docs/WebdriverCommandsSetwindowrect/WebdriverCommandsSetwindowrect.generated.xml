The <strong>Set Window Rect</strong> <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands">command</see> of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver">WebDriver</see> API alters the size and position of the operating system window associated with the current <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"><c>window</c></see>. The command acts as the setter of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands/GetWindowRect">Get Window Rect</see>, which return object you can pass directly as this command&amp;apos;s payload.

<remarks>
<para>Certain subsets of devices do not support setting the window dimensions or its position. On these configurations the command will return an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Errors/UnsupportedOperation">unsupported operating</see> error. To avoid running into situations where calling this might error it is possible to call it conditionally on whether the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/setWindowRect"><c>setWindowRect</c> capability</see> is set to true for the session.</para><para>Setting the window rect takes <c>x</c>, <c>y</c>, <c>width</c>, and <c>height</c> as input. All the fields are optional, e.g. the command may be called with an empty object, and in this case it will act as a no-op. To set the position both of <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> are required, and correspondingly both <c>width</c> and <c>height</c> are required for altering the window&amp;apos;s dimensions.</para><para>When setting the width or height, it is not guaranteed that the resulting window size will exactly match that which was requested. The driver is expected to clamp values that are larger than the physical screen dimensions, or smaller than the minimum window size. Some drivers may also have other limitations such as not being able to resize in single-pixel increments. For this reason, the returned <c>width</c> and <c>height</c> might not exactly match <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/outerWidth"><c>Window.outerWidth</c></see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/outerHeight"><c>Window.outerHeight</c></see>.</para><para>Setting the window&amp;apos;s position is similar in nature to calling <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/moveTo"><c>Window.moveTo(x, y)</c></see>, but differences itself by bypassing security restrictions related to window manipulation.</para><para>The Set Window Rect command is blocking.</para>
