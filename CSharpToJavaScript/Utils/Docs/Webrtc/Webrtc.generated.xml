<summary>
In order to more fully support audio/video conferencing, <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> supports sending {{Glossary("DTMF")}} to the remote peer on an <see cref="RTCPeerConnection"/>. This article offers a brief high-level overview of how DTMF works over WebRTC, then provides a guide for everyday developers about how to send DTMF over an <c>RTCPeerConnection</c>. The DTMF system is often referred to as &amp;quot;touch tone,&amp;quot; after an old trade name for the system.

<remarks>
<para>WebRTC doesn&amp;apos;t send DTMF codes as audio data. Instead, they&amp;apos;re sent out-of-band, as RTP payloads. Note, however, that although it&amp;apos;s possible to <strong>send</strong> DTMF using WebRTC, there is currently no way to detect or receive <strong>incoming</strong> DTMF. WebRTC currently ignores these payloads; this is because WebRTC&amp;apos;s DTMF support is primarily intended for use with legacy telephone services that rely on DTMF tones to perform tasks such as:</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> While the DTMF is not sent to the remote peer as audio, browsers may choose to play the corresponding tone to the local user as part of their user experience, since users are typically used to hearing their phone play the tones audibly.</para></blockquote>
