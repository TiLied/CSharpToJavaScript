<WebTransportCreateBidirectionalStream>
<summary>
The <strong><c>createBidirectionalStream()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="WebTransport"/> interface asynchronously opens and returns a bidirectional stream.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The method returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to a <see cref="WebTransportBidirectionalStream"/> object, which has <c>readable</c> and <c>writable</c> properties that can be used to reliably read from and write to the server.<br/>&amp;quot;Reliable&amp;quot; means that transmission and order of data are guaranteed.<br/>This provides slower delivery (albeit faster than with WebSockets) than <see cref="WebTransport.Datagrams"/>, but is needed in situations where reliability and ordering are important, like chat applications.</para><para>The relative order in which queued bytes are emptied from created streams can be specified using the <c>sendOrder</c> option.<br/>If set, queued bytes in streams with a higher send order are guaranteed to be sent before queued bytes for streams with a lower send order.<br/>If the order number is not set then the order in which bytes are sent is implementation dependent.<br/>Note however that even though bytes from higher send-order streams are sent first, they may not arrive first.</para>
