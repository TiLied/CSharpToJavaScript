<summary>

</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The <see cref="Window.Beforeprint_event"/> and <c>afterprint</c> events allow pages to change their content before printing starts (perhaps to remove a banner, for example) and then revert those changes after printing has completed. In general, you should prefer the use of a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#targeting_media_types"><c>_media print</c></see> CSS at-rule, but it may be necessary to use these events in some cases.</para>
