<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The read-only <see cref="Window"/> property <strong><c>event</c></strong> returns the <see cref="Event"/> which is currently being handled by the site's code. Outside the context of an event handler, the value is always <c>undefined</c>.

<para>You <strong>should</strong> avoid using this property in new code, and should instead use the <see cref="Event"/> passed into the event handler function. This property is not universally supported and even when supported introduces potential fragility to your code.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> This property can be fragile, in that there may be situations in which the returned <c>Event</c> is not the expected value. In addition, <c>Window.event</c> is not accurate for events dispatched within <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/shadow tree">shadow tree</see>.</para></blockquote>
