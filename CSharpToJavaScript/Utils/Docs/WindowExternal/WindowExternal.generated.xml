<summary>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>IMPORTANT</h5> <strong>Deprecated</strong></div> The <c>external</c> property of the <see cref="Window"/> API returns an instance of the <c>External</c> interface, which was intended to contain functions related to adding external search providers to the browser. However, this is now deprecated, and the contained methods are now dummy functions that do nothing as per spec.
