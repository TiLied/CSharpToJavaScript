<WindowLoad_event>
<summary>
The <strong><c>load</c></strong> event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.<br/>This is in contrast to <see cref="Document/DOMContentLoaded_event"/>, which is fired as soon as the page DOM has been loaded, without waiting for resources to finish loading.

<para>This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>All events named </strong><strong><c>load</c></strong><strong> will not propagate to </strong><strong><c>Window</c></strong>, even with <c>bubbles</c> initialized to <c>true</c>. To catch <c>load</c> events on the <c>window</c>, that <c>load</c> event must be dispatched directly to the <c>window</c>.</para></blockquote><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> The <c>load</c> event that is dispatched when the main document has loaded <strong>is</strong> dispatched on the <c>window</c>, but has two mutated properties: <c>target</c> is <c>document</c>, and <c>path</c> is <c>undefined</c>. These two properties are mutated due to legacy conformance.</para></blockquote>
