<WindowScrollX>
<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>scrollX</c></strong> property of the <see cref="Window"/> interface returns the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled horizontally. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled vertically from the <see cref="Window.ScrollY"/> property.

<value>A double-precision floating-point value indicating the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled horizontally from the origin, where a positive value means the content is scrolled to the right (to reveal more content to the right). In more technical terms, <c>scrollX</c> returns the X coordinate of the left edge of the current <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport">viewport</see>. If the document isn't scrolled at all left or right, then <c>scrollX</c> is 0. If there is no viewport, the returned value is 0. If the document is rendered on a subpixel-precise device, then the returned value is also subpixel-precise and may contain a decimal component.<blockquote>If you need an integer value, you can use <see cref="MathRound"/> to round it off.</blockquote>It&amp;apos;s possible for <c>scrollX</c> to be negative if the document can be scrolled to the left from the initial containing block. For example, if the document is right-to-left and content grows to the left.Safari responds to overscrolling by updating <c>scrollX</c> beyond the maximum scroll position (unless the default "bounce" effect is disabled, such as by setting <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior">overscroll-behavior</see> to <c>none</c>), while Chrome and Firefox do not.This property is read-only. To scroll the window to a particular place, use <see cref="Window.Scroll"/>.</value>
