<WindowScrollY>
<summary>
The read-only <strong><c>scrollY</c></strong> property of the <see cref="Window"/> interface returns the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled vertically. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled horizontally from the <see cref="Window.ScrollX"/> property.

</remarks>
<value>A double-precision floating-point value indicating the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled vertically from the origin, where a positive value means the content is scrolled down (to reveal more content to the bottom). In more technical terms, <c>scrollY</c> returns the Y coordinate of the top edge of the current <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport">viewport</see>. If the document isn't scrolled at all top or down, then <c>scrollY</c> is 0. If there is no viewport, the returned value is 0. If the document is rendered on a subpixel-precise device, then the returned value is also subpixel-precise and may contain a decimal component.<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5>If you need an integer value, you can use <see cref="MathRound"/> to round it off.</blockquote>Safari responds to overscrolling by updating <c>scrollY</c> beyond the maximum scroll position (unless the default "bounce" effect is disabled, such as by setting <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior">overscroll-behavior</see> to <c>none</c>), while Chrome and Firefox do not. For example, <c>scrollY</c> may be negative on Safari just by continuing to scroll up when the document is already at the top.This property is read-only. To scroll the window to a particular place, use <see cref="Window.Scroll"/>.</value>
