<WindowWindow>
<summary>
The <strong><c>window</c></strong> property of a <see cref="Window"/> object points to the window object itself.

<para>Thus, the following expressions all return the same window object:</para><para>In web pages, the window object is also a <strong>global object</strong>. This means:</para><para>The point of having the <c>window</c> property refer to the object itself, was likely to make it easy to refer to the global object. Otherwise, you&amp;apos;d have to do a manual <c>let window = this;</c> assignment at the top of your script.</para><para>Another reason, is that without this property you wouldn't be able to write, for example, "<see cref="Window.Open"/>". You'd have to use "open('http://google.com/&amp;apos;)&amp;quot; instead.</para><para>Yet another reason to use this property, is for libraries which wish to offer OOP-versions, and non-OOP versions (especially JavaScript modules). For example, if we refer to &amp;quot;this.window.location.href&amp;quot;, a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">JavaScript module</see> could define a property called &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; inside of a class it defined (since no global &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; variable exists for it by default) which could be created after passing in a window object to the module class&amp;apos; constructor. Thus, &amp;quot;this.window&amp;quot; inside of its functions would refer to that window object. In the non-namespaced version, &amp;quot;this.window&amp;quot; would refer back to &amp;quot;window&amp;quot;, and also be able to readily get the document location. Another advantage, is that the objects of such a class (even if the class were defined outside of a module) could change their reference to the window at will, they would not be able to do this if they had hard-coded a reference to &amp;quot;window&amp;quot;. The default in the class could still be set as the current window object.</para>
