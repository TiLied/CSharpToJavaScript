<WorkerGlobalScope>
<summary>
The <strong><c>WorkerGlobalScope</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers API</see> is an interface representing the scope of any worker. Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by <see cref="Window"/> objects â€” in this case event handlers, the console or the associated <see cref="WorkerNavigator"/> object. Each <c>WorkerGlobalScope</c> has its own event loop.

<remarks>
<para>This interface is usually specialized by each worker type: <see cref="DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope"/> for dedicated workers, <see cref="SharedWorkerGlobalScope"/> for shared workers, and <see cref="ServiceWorkerGlobalScope"/> for <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">ServiceWorker</see>. The <c>self</c> property returns the specialized scope for each context.</para><para></para>
