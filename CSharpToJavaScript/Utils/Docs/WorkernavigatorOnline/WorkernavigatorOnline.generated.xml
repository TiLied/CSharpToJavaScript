<WorkerNavigatorOnLine>
<summary>
Returns the online status of the browser. The property returns a boolean value, with <c>true</c> meaning online and <c>false</c> meaning offline. The property sends updates whenever the browser&amp;apos;s ability to connect to the network changes. The update occurs when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>For example, the property should return <c>false</c> when users click links soon after they lose internet connection.</para><para>Browsers implement this property differently.</para><para>In Chrome and Safari, if the browser is not able to connect to a local area network (LAN) or a router, it is offline; all other conditions return <c>true</c>. So while you can assume that the browser is offline when it returns a <c>false</c> value, you cannot assume that a true value necessarily means that the browser can access the internet. You could be getting false positives, such as in cases where the computer is running a virtualization software that has virtual ethernet adapters that are always<br/>&amp;quot;connected.&amp;quot; Therefore, if you really want to determine the online status of the browser, you should develop additional means for checking.
