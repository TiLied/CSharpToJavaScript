<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> The <strong><c>remainingBudget()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="WorkletSharedStorage"/> interface returns the remaining navigation budget for the current origin.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The navigation budget is the number of entropy bits permitted inside a {{htmlelement("fencedframe")}} due to the <see cref="WindowSharedStorage.SelectURL"/> calls per origin every 24 hours. This is not the same as the number of navigations; rather, it is based on the number of potential navigations in each call. Each time a <c>selectURL()</c> navigation occurs, the corresponding origin&amp;apos;s budget decreases by the logarithm (base 2) of the number of URL choices.</para><para>Navigation budget is a mechanism designed to limit the rate of leakage of cross-site data to the destination pages navigated to in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API">fenced frames</see>.</para>
