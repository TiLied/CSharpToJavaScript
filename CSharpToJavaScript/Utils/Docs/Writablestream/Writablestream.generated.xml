<WritableStream>
<summary>
The <strong><c>WritableStream</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">Streams API</see> provides a standard abstraction for writing streaming data to a destination, known as a sink.<br/>This object comes with built-in backpressure and queuing.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para><c>WritableStream</c> is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects">transferable object</see>.</para>

<WritableStreamAbort>
<summary>
The <strong><c>abort()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="WritableStream"/> interface aborts the stream, signaling that the producer can no longer successfully write to the stream and it is to be immediately moved to an error state, with any queued writes discarded.

<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/>, which fulfills with the value given in the <c>reason</c> parameter.</returns>
</WritableStreamAbort>
<WritableStreamClose>
<summary>
The <strong><c>close()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="WritableStream"/> interface closes the associated stream. All chunks written before this method is called are sent before the returned promise is fulfilled.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is equivalent to getting a <see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter"/> with <see cref="WritableStream.GetWriter"/>, calling <see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter.Close"/> on it.</para>
<para><seealso href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/close"> <em>See also on MDN</em> </seealso></para>
</remarks>
<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/> which fulfills with the <c>undefined</c> when all<br/>remaining chunks were successfully written before the close, or rejects with an error if<br/>a problem was encountered during the process.</returns>
</WritableStreamClose>
<WritableStreamGetWriter>
<summary>
The <strong><c>getWriter()</c></strong> method of the <see cref="WritableStream"/> interface returns a new instance of <see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter"/> and locks the stream to that instance.<br/>While the stream is locked, no other writer can be acquired until this one is released.

</WritableStreamGetWriter>
<WritableStreamLocked>
<summary>
The <strong><c>locked</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="WritableStream"/> interface returns a boolean indicating whether the <c>WritableStream</c> is locked to a writer.

<WritableStreamWritableStream>
<summary>
The <strong><c>WritableStream()</c></strong> constructor creates a new <see cref="WritableStream"/> object instance.
