<WritableStreamDefaultWriterAbort>
<summary>
The <strong><c>abort()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter."/> interface aborts the stream, signaling that<br/>the producer can no longer successfully write to the stream and it is to be immediately<br/>moved to an error state, with any queued writes discarded.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>If the writer is active, the <c>abort()</c> method behaves the same as that for<br/>the associated stream (<see cref="WritableStream.Abort."/>). If not, it returns a<br/>rejected promise.</para>
<para><seealso href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStreamDefaultWriter/abort"> <em>See also on MDN</em> </seealso></para>
</remarks>
<returns>A <see cref="Promise"/>, which fulfills to <c>undefined</c> when the stream is aborted, or<br/>rejects with an error if the writer was inactive or the receiver stream is invalid.</returns>
