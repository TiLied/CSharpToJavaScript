<summary>
The <strong><c>abort()</c></strong> method of the<br/><see cref="WritableStreamDefaultWriter"/> interface aborts the stream, signaling that<br/>the producer can no longer successfully write to the stream and it is to be immediately<br/>moved to an error state, with any queued writes discarded.

<remarks>
<para>If the writer is active, the <c>abort()</c> method behaves the same as that for<br/>the associated stream (<see cref="WritableStream.Abort"/>). If not, it returns a<br/>rejected promise.</para>
