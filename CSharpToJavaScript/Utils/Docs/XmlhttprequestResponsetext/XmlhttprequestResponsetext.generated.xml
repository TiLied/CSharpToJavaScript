<value>A string which contains either the textual data received using the<br/><c>XMLHttpRequest</c> or <c>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</c> if the request failed or if no content has been received yet.While handling an asynchronous request, the value of <c>responseText</c> always<br/>has the current content received from the server, even if it&amp;apos;s incomplete because the<br/>data has not been completely received yet.You know the entire content has been received when the value of<br/><see cref="XMLHttpRequest.ReadyState"/> becomes<br/><c>XMLHttpRequest.DONE</c> (<c>4</c>), and<br/><see cref="XMLHttpRequest.Status"/> becomes 200 (<c>&amp;quot;OK&amp;quot;</c>).</value>
