<XMLHttpRequestSending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data>
<summary>
This example reads an image as a binary file and creates an 8-bit unsigned integer array from the raw bytes. Note that this will not decode the image and read the pixels. You will need a <see href="https://github.com/foliojs/png.js">png decoding library</see> for that.

<remarks>
<para>You can also read a binary file as a <see cref="Blob"/> by setting the string <c>&amp;quot;blob&amp;quot;</c> to the <c>responseType</c> property.</para>
