<XPath>
<summary>
XPath stands for XML Path Language. It uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction">XML</see> document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.

<remarks>
<para>XPath is mainly used in <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT">XSLT</see>, but can also be used as a much more powerful way of navigating through the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</see> of any XML-like language document using <see cref="XPathExpression."/>, such as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</see>, instead of relying on the <see cref="Document.GetElementById."/> or <see cref="Document.QuerySelectorAll."/> methods, the <see cref="Node.ChildNodes."/> properties, and other DOM Core features.</para><para>XPath uses a path notation (as in URLs) for navigating through the hierarchical structure of an XML document. It uses a non-XML syntax so that it can be used in URIs and XML attribute values.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Support for XPath varies widely; it&amp;apos;s supported reasonably well in Firefox (although there are no plans to improve support further), while other browsers implement it to a lesser extent, if at all.
