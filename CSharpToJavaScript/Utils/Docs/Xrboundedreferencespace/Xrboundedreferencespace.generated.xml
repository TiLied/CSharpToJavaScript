<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR Device API</see>&amp;apos;s <strong><c>XRBoundedReferenceSpace</c></strong> interface describes a virtual world <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Geometry">reference space</see> which has preset boundaries. This extends <see cref="XRReferenceSpace"/>, which describes an essentially unrestricted space around the viewer's position. These bounds are defined using an array of points, each of which defines a vertex in a polygon inside which the user is allowed to move.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This is typically used when the XR system is capable of tracking the user&amp;apos;s physical movement within a limited distance of their starting position. The specified bounds may, in fact, describe the shape and size of the room the user is located in, in order to let the WebXR site or application prevent the user from colliding with the walls or other obstacles in the real world. At a minimum, the boundaries indicate the area in which the XR device is capable of tracking the user&amp;apos;s movement. See the article <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Bounded_reference_spaces">Using bounded reference spaces</see> for details on how bounded spaces work and why they&amp;apos;re useful.</para><para></para>

<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> The read-only <see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace"/><br/>property <strong><c>boundsGeometry</c></strong> is an array of<br/><see cref="DOMPointReadOnly"/> objects which specifies the points making up a polygon<br/>inside which the viewer is allowed to move. Each point is treated as a<br/>two-dimensional point, and must be located at ground level (that is,<br/>its <c>y</c> coordinate must be 0).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This boundary is typically configured by the user, using the software that controls<br/>their XR hardware. This may be done by walking the border of the space they wish to use,<br/>or by drawing the shape of their room using their XR input device. Theoretically, a more<br/>advanced system might use sensors or other detection methods to determine the bounds of<br/>a dedicated XR room (notice how we carefully don&amp;apos;t call it a holodeck?).</para>

<value>The <c>boundsGeometry</c> property is an array of <see cref="DOMPointReadOnly"/><br/>objects, each of which defines one vertex in a polygon inside which the viewer is<br/>required to remain. Each point must be at floor level, with<br/>its <c>y</c> coordinate&amp;apos;s value set to 0. Additionally, the value<br/>of <c>w</c> is always 1 in every point in the array. Additionally, the<br/>points <strong>must</strong> be listed in clockwise order.Each entry in <c>boundsGeometry</c> is equal to an entry in the list of native<br/>bounds geometry points for the room, premultiplied by the inverse of the origin offset.<br/>In other words, the bounds are the physical limitations of the available space, shifted<br/>so that the reference space&amp;apos;s bounds points are all defined relative to the<br/><c>XRBoundedReferenceSpace</c>&amp;apos;s effective origin.</value>
