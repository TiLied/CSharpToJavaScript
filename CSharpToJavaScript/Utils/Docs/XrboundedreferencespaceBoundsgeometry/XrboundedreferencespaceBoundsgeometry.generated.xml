<summary>
The read-only <see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace"/><br/>property <strong><c>boundsGeometry</c></strong> is an array of<br/><see cref="DOMPointReadOnly"/> objects which specifies the points making up a polygon<br/>inside which the viewer is allowed to move. Each point is treated as a<br/>two-dimensional point, and must be located at ground level (that is,<br/>its <c>y</c> coordinate must be 0).
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This boundary is typically configured by the user, using the software that controls<br/>their XR hardware. This may be done by walking the border of the space they wish to use,<br/>or by drawing the shape of their room using their XR input device. Theoretically, a more<br/>advanced system might use sensors or other detection methods to determine the bounds of<br/>a dedicated XR room (notice how we carefully don&amp;apos;t call it a holodeck?).</para>

</remarks>
<value>The <c>boundsGeometry</c> property is an array of <see cref="DOMPointReadOnly"/><br/>objects, each of which defines one vertex in a polygon inside which the viewer is<br/>required to remain. Each point must be at floor level, with<br/>its <c>y</c> coordinate&amp;apos;s value set to 0. Additionally, the value<br/>of <c>w</c> is always 1 in every point in the array. Additionally, the<br/>points <strong>must</strong> be listed in clockwise order.Each entry in <c>boundsGeometry</c> is equal to an entry in the list of native<br/>bounds geometry points for the room, premultiplied by the inverse of the origin offset.<br/>In other words, the bounds are the physical limitations of the available space, shifted<br/>so that the reference space&amp;apos;s bounds points are all defined relative to the<br/><c>XRBoundedReferenceSpace</c>&amp;apos;s effective origin.</value>
