<XRInputSourceGripSpace>
<summary>
The read-only <see cref="XRInputSource."/> property <strong><c>gripSpace</c></strong> returns an <see cref="XRSpace."/> whose native origin tracks the pose used to render virtual objects so they appear to be held in (or part of) the user's hand. For example, if a user were holding a virtual straight rod, the native origin of this <c>XRSpace</c> would be located at the approximate center of mass of the user&amp;apos;s fist.

<value>An <see cref="XRSpace."/> object representing the position and orientation of the input<br/>device in virtual space, suitable for rendering an image of the device into the scene.<br/><c>gripSpace</c> is <c>null</c> if the input source is not inherently<br/>trackable. For example, only inputs whose <see cref="XRInputSource.TargetRayMode."/> is <c>tracked-pointer</c> provide a <c>gripSpace</c>.Imagine that the controller is shaped like a straight rod, held in the user&amp;apos;s fist.
