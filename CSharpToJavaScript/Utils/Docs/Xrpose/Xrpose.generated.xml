<XRPose>
<summary>
<c>XRPose</c> is a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR API</see> interface representing a position and orientation in the 3D space, relative to the <see cref="XRSpace"/> within which it resides. The <c>XRSpace</c>—which is either an <see cref="XRReferenceSpace"/> or an <see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace"/>—defines the coordinate system used for the pose and, in the case of an <see cref="XRViewerPose"/>, its underlying views.

<remarks>
<para>To obtain the <c>XRPose</c> for the <c>XRSpace</c> used as the local coordinate system of an object, call <see cref="XRFrame.GetPose"/>, specifying that local <c>XRSpace</c> and the space to which you wish to convert:</para><para>The pose for a viewer (or camera) is represented by the <see cref="XRViewerPose"/> subclass of <c>XRPose</c>. This is obtained using <see cref="XRFrame.GetViewerPose"/> instead of <c>getPose()</c>, specifying a reference space which has been adjusted to position and orient the node to provide the desired viewing position and angle:</para><para>Here, <c>adjReferenceSpace</c> is a reference space which has been updated using the base frame of reference for the frame and any adjustments needed to position the viewer based on movement or rotation which is being supplied from a source other than the XR device, such as keyboard or mouse inputs.</para><para>See the article <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Movement_and_motion">Movement, orientation, and motion</see> for further details and an example with thorough explanations of what&amp;apos;s going on.</para>
