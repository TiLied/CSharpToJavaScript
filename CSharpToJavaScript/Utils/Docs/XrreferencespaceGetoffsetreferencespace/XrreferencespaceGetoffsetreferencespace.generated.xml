<summary>
The <see cref="XRReferenceSpace."/><br/>interface&amp;apos;s <strong><c>getOffsetReferenceSpace()</c></strong> method returns a<br/>new reference space object which describes the relative difference in position between<br/>the object on which the method is called and a given point in 3D space. The<br/>object returned by <c>getOffsetReferenceSpace()</c> is an<br/><see cref="XRReferenceSpace."/> if called on an <c>XRReferenceSpace</c>, or an<br/><see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace."/> if called on an object of that type.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>In other words, when you have an object in 3D space and need to position another object<br/>relative to that one, you can call <c>getOffsetReferenceSpace()</c>, passing into<br/>it the position and orientation you want the second object to have<br/><strong>relative to the position and orientation of the object on which you call </strong><strong><c>getOffsetReferenceSpace()</c></strong>.</para><para>Then, when drawing the scene, you can use the offset reference space to not only<br/>position objects relative to one another, but to apply the needed transforms to render<br/>objects properly based upon the viewer&amp;apos;s position. This is demonstrated in the example<br/><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#implementing_rotation_based_on_non-xr_inputs">Implementing rotation based on non-XR inputs</see>, which demonstrates a way to<br/>use this method to let the user use their mouse to pitch and yaw their viewing angle.</para>

<returns>A new <see cref="XRReferenceSpace."/> object describing a reference space with the same<br/>native origin as the reference space on which the method was called, but with an origin<br/>offset indicating the distance from the object to the point given<br/>by <c>originOffset</c>.If the object on which you call this method is an<br/><see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace."/>, the returned object is one as well. The<br/><see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace.BoundsGeometry."/> of the new<br/>reference space is set to the original object&amp;apos;s <c>boundsGeometry</c> with each of<br/>its points multiplied by the inverse of <c>originOffset</c>.</returns>
