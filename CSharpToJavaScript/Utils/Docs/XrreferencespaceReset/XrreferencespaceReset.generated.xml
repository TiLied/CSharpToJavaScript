<XRReferenceSpaceReset_event>
<summary>
The <strong><c>reset</c></strong> event is sent to an <see cref="XRReferenceSpace"/> object when a discontinuity is detected in either the native origin or the effective origin, causing a jump in the position or orientation of objects oriented using the reference space. This is common when the user calibrates or recalibrates an XR device, or if the device automatically changes its origin after losing tracking of the user, then re-gaining it.
