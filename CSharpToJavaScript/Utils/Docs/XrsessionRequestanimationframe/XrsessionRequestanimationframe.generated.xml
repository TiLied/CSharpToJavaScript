<XRSessionRequestAnimationFrame>
<summary>
The <see cref="XRSession"/><br/>method <strong><c>requestAnimationFrame()</c></strong>, much like the<br/><see cref="Window"/> method of the same name, schedules a callback to be executed the<br/>next time the browser is ready to paint the session&amp;apos;s virtual environment to the XR<br/>display. The specified callback is executed once before the next repaint; if<br/>you wish for it to be executed for the following repaint, you must<br/>call <c>requestAnimationFrame()</c> again. This can be done from within the<br/>callback itself.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The callback takes two parameters as inputs: an <see cref="XRFrame"/> describing the<br/>state of all tracked objects for the session, and a timestamp you can use to compute<br/>any animation updates needed.</para><para>You can cancel a previously scheduled animation by calling<br/><see cref="XRSession.CancelAnimationFrame"/>.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para><strong>Note:</strong> Despite the obvious similarities between these methods and the<br/>global <see cref="Window.RequestAnimationFrame"/> function<br/>provided by the <c>Window</c> interface, you <strong>must not</strong> treat these as<br/>interchangeable. There is <strong>no</strong> guarantee that the latter will work at all while<br/>an immersive XR session is underway.</para></blockquote>
