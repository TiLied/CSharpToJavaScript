<summary>
The <strong><c>XRSpace</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR Device API</see> is an abstract interface providing a common basis for every class which represents a virtual coordinate system within the virtual world, in which its origin corresponds to a physical location. Spatial data in WebXR is always expressed relative to an object based upon one of the descendant interfaces of <c>XRSpace</c>, at the time at which a given <see cref="XRFrame"/> takes place.

<remarks>
<para>Numeric values such as pose positions are thus coordinates in the corresponding <c>XRSpace</c>, relative to that space&amp;apos;s origin.</para><blockquote><para>The <c>XRSpace</c> interface is never used directly; instead, all spaces are created using one of the interfaces based on <c>XRSpace</c>. At this time, those are <see cref="XRReferenceSpace"/>, <see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace"/>, and <see cref="XRJointSpace"/>.</para></blockquote><para></para>
