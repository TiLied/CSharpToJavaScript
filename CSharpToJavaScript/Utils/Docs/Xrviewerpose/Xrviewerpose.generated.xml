<XRViewerPose>
<summary>
The WebXR Device API interface <strong><c>XRViewerPose</c></strong> represents the pose (the position and orientation) of a viewer&amp;apos;s point of view on the scene. Each <c>XRViewerPose</c> can have multiple views to represent, for example, the slight separation between the left and right eye.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This view can represent anything from the point-of-view of a user&amp;apos;s XR headset to the viewpoint represented by a player&amp;apos;s movement of an avatar using mouse and keyboard, presented on the screen, to a virtual camera capturing the scene for a spectator.</para><para></para>

<XRViewerPoseViews>
<summary>
The read-only <see cref="XRViewerPose"/> property <strong><c>views</c></strong><br/>returns an array which contains every <see cref="XRView"/> which must be rendered in<br/>order to fully represent the scene from the viewpoint defined by the viewer pose. For<br/>monoscopic devices, this array contains a single view.
</summary>
<remarks>
<blockquote class="WARNING"><h5>WARNING</h5><para>There is no guarantee that the number of views will<br/>remain constant over the lifetime of an <see cref="XRSession"/>. For each frame, you<br/>should always use the current length of this array rather than caching the value.</para></blockquote><para>Stereo views require two views to render properly, with the left eye&amp;apos;s view having its<br/><see cref="XRView.Eye"/> set to the string <c>left</c> and the right eye&amp;apos;s<br/>view a value of <c>right</c>.</para>

<value>An array of <see cref="XRView"/> objects, one for each view available as part of the<br/>scene for the current viewer pose. This array&amp;apos;s length may potentially vary over the<br/>lifetime of the <see cref="XRSession"/> (for example, if the viewer enables or disables<br/>stereo mode on their XR output device).</value>
