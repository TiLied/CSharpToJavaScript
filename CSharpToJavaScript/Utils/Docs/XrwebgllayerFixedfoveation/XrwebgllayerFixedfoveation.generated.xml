<summary>
The <strong><c>fixedFoveation</c></strong> property of the <see cref="XRWebGLLayer"/> interface is a number indicating the amount of foveation used by the XR compositor. Fixed Foveated Rendering (FFR) renders the edges of the eye textures at a lower resolution than the center and reduces the GPU load.

<remarks>
<para>It is most useful for low contrast textures, such as background images but less for high contrast ones such as text or detailed images. Authors can adjust the level on a per frame basis to achieve the best tradeoff between performance and visual quality.</para>

<value>A number between 0 and 1.It's up to the user agent how to interpret the numbers in this range. When changing the foveation level, the effect will visible in the next <see cref="XRFrame"/>.Note that some user agents might implement certain levels of foveation, so you might need to adjust the foveation level in large increments to see an effect. Example levels:Some devices don&amp;apos;t support foveated rendering. In that case <c>fixedFoveation</c> is <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null"><c>null</c></see> and setting it will not do anything.</value>
