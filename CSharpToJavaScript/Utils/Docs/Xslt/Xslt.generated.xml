<para>Although the process is referred to as &amp;quot;transformation,&amp;quot; the original document is not changed; rather, a new XML document is created based on the content of an existing document. Then, the new document may be serialized (output) by the processor in standard XML syntax or in another format, such as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</see> or plain text.</para><para>XSLT is most often used to convert data between different XML schemas or to convert XML data into web pages or PDF documents.</para>
