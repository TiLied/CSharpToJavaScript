<XSLTElementFor-each>
<summary>
The <c>&amp;lt;xsl:for-each&amp;gt;</c> element selects a set of nodes and processes each of them in the same way. It is often used to iterate through a set of nodes or to change the current node. If one or more <c>&amp;lt;xsl:sort&amp;gt;</c> elements appear as the children of this element, sorting occurs before processing. Otherwise, nodes are processed in document order.
