<summary>
The <c>&amp;lt;xsl:import&amp;gt;</c> element is a top-level element that serves to import the contents of one stylesheet into another stylesheet. Generally speaking, the contents of the imported stylesheet have a lower import precedence than that of the importing stylesheet. This is in contrast to <c>&amp;lt;xsl:include&amp;gt;</c> where the contents of the included stylesheet have exactly the same precedence as the contents of the including stylesheet.
