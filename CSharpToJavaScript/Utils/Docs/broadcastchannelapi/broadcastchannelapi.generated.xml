<summary>
The <strong>Broadcast Channel API</strong> allows basic communication between <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/browsing context">browsing context</see> (that is, <strong>windows</strong>, <strong>tabs</strong>, <strong>frames</strong>, or <strong>iframes</strong>) and workers on the same <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin">origin</see>.

<remarks>
<blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>To be exact, communication is allowed between browsing contexts using the same <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning">storage partition</see>. Storage is first partitioned according to top-level sites—so for example, if you have one opened page at <c>a.com</c> that embeds an iframe from <c>b.com</c>, and another page opened to <c>b.com</c>, then the iframe cannot communicate with the second page despite them being technically same-origin. However, if the first page is also on <c>b.com</c>, then the iframe can communicate with the second page.</para></blockquote><para>By creating a <see cref="BroadcastChannel"/> object, you can receive any messages that are posted to it. You don't have to maintain a reference to the frames or workers you wish to communicate with: they can "subscribe" to a particular channel by constructing their own <see cref="BroadcastChannel"/> with the same name, and have bi-directional communication between all of them.</para><para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orgbroadcastchannel.png">The principle of the Broadcast Channel API</see></para>
