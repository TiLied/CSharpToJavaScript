<CSS_Object_Model>
<summary>
The <strong>CSS Object Model</strong> is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The values of CSS are represented untyped, that is using <see cref="String"/> objects.</para>

<summary>
A <strong>CSS declaration</strong> is an abstract concept not exposed as an object in the DOM. It represents a CSS property and value pairing.

<CSS_Object_ModelCSS_value_serialization>
<summary>
Some CSSOM APIs <strong>serialize</strong> property values into standardized string representations based on the value&amp;apos;s <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/Data_types">data type</see>. For example, you might set a color using the <c>hsl(240 100% 50%)</c> syntax, but when accessed through JavaScript, the value will be returned in the equivalent <c>&amp;quot;rgb(0, 0, 255)&amp;quot;</c> syntax.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>CSS data types can often be expressed in multiple syntaxes. For example, the {{cssxref(&amp;quot;&amp;lt;color&amp;gt;&amp;quot;)}} data type can be represented using named colors (<c>red</c>), hexadecimal notation (<c>#ff0000</c>), functional notation (<c>rgb(255 0 0)</c>), and more. These different syntaxes are exactly equivalent at every stage of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Cascade/Property_value_processing">CSS value processing</see>, similar to how in JavaScript, the same string can be written with single quotes or double quotes, or the same number can be written in different formats (like <c>16</c>, <c>16.0</c>, or <c>0x10</c>).</para><para>Because CSS converts all these surface representations to the same underlying value during value processing, it is often impossible to recover the original syntax from the already-parsed CSSOM. Furthermore, a <strong>canonical</strong> representation is often more useful for scripts, because it allows comparisons and calculations based on how the content is presented to the user, rather than how it was originally authored.</para>

<CSS_Object_ModelUsing_dynamic_styling_information>
<summary>
The CSS Object Model (CSSOM), part of the DOM, exposes specific interfaces allowing manipulation of a wide amount of information regarding CSS. Initially defined in the <strong>DOM Level 2 Style</strong> recommendation, these interfaces forms now a specification, <strong>CSS Object Model (CSSOM)</strong> which aims at superseding it.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>In many cases, and where possible, it is best practice to dynamically manipulate classes via the <see cref="Element.ClassName"/> property since the ultimate appearance of all of the styling hooks can be controlled in a single stylesheet. One's JavaScript code also becomes cleaner since instead of being dedicated to styling details, it can focus on the overall semantics of each section it is creating or manipulating, leaving the precise style details to the stylesheet. However, there are cases where actually obtaining or manipulating the rules can be useful (whether for whole stylesheets or individual elements), and that is described in further detail below. Note also that, as with individual element's DOM styles, when speaking of manipulating the stylesheets, this is not actually manipulating the physical document(s), but merely the internal representation of the document.</para><para>The basic <c>style</c> object exposes the <see cref="Stylesheet"/> and the <see cref="CSSStylesheet"/> interfaces. Those interfaces contain members like <c>insertRule</c>, <c>selectorText</c>, and <c>parentStyleSheet</c> for accessing and manipulating the individual style rules that make up a CSS stylesheet.</para><para>To get to the <c>style</c> objects from the <c>document</c>, you can use the <see cref="Document.StyleSheets"/> property and access the individual objects by index (e.g., <c>document.styleSheets[0]</c> is the first stylesheet defined for the document, etc.). You can also access the <see cref="HTMLStyleElement.Sheet"/> property on a specific <c>&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;</c> element to get its associated stylesheet object.</para>
