In this page we&amp;apos;ll describe how to interpret a profile captured using the Self-Profiling API.

<remarks>
<para>The format of the object returned by <see cref="Profiler.Stop"/> is designed to be space-efficient: for example, the format aims to avoid duplicating URL values for functions which are defined in the same script. This means that some interpretation is needed to understand how a sample in the profile object maps to a location in the program, and this guide page aims to explain how to perform this interpretation.</para><para>In the first section, we&amp;apos;ll describe the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#anatomy_of_a_profile">abstract structure of a profile</see>. In the next section we&amp;apos;ll describe <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#profile_format">the format of the profile object</see> returned by <see cref="Profiler.Stop"/>. Finally we'll <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#example">walk through an example</see> to show what a profile for a given program looks like and how it can be interpreted.</para>
