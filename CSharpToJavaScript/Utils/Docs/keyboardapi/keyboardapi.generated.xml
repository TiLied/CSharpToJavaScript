<remarks>
<para>It provides several capabilities. <strong>Keyboard mapping</strong> provides an interface for retrieving the string generated by particular physical key on a keyboard to correctly identify that key to a user. <strong>Keyboard locking</strong> enables a web page to capture keys that are normally reserved by the user agent or the underlying operating system. The intended use of the Keyboard API is by web applications such as games or remote access apps that provide a fullscreen immersive experience.</para>
