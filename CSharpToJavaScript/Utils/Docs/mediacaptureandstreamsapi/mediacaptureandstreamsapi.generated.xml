<summary>
The <strong>Media Capture and Streams</strong> API, often called the <strong>Media Streams API</strong> or <strong>MediaStream API</strong>, is an API related to <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</see> which provides support for streaming audio and video data.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>It provides the interfaces and methods for working with the streams and their constituent tracks, the constraints associated with data formats, the success and error callbacks when using the data asynchronously, and the events that are fired during the process.</para>

<Media_Capture_and_Streams_APIConstraints>
<summary>
This article discusses the twin concepts of <strong>constraints</strong> and <strong>capabilities</strong>, as well as media settings, and includes an example we call the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#example_constraint_exerciser">Constraint Exerciser</see>. The Constraint Exerciser lets you experiment with the results of different constraint sets being applied to the audio and video tracks coming from the computer&amp;apos;s A/V input devices (such as its webcam and microphone).

<remarks>
<para>Historically, writing scripts for the Web that work intimately with Web APIs has had a well-known challenge: often, your code needs to know whether or not an API exists and if so, what its limitations are on the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see> it's running on. Figuring this out has often been difficult, and has usually involved looking at some combination of which <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see> (or browser) you're running on, which version it is, looking to see if certain objects exist, trying to see whether various things work or not and determining what errors occur, and so forth. The result has been a lot of very fragile code, or a reliance on libraries which figure this stuff out for you, then implement <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/polyfill">polyfill</see> to patch the holes in the implementation on your behalf.</para><para>Capabilities and constraints let the browser and website or app exchange information about what <strong>constrainable properties</strong> the browser&amp;apos;s implementation supports and what values it supports for each.</para>
