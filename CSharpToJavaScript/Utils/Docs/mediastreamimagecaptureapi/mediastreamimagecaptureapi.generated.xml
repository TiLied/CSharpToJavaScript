<summary>
The <strong>MediaStream Image Capture API</strong> is an API for capturing images or videos from a photographic device. In addition to capturing data, it also allows you to retrieve information about device capabilities such as image size, red-eye reduction and whether or not there is a flash and what they are currently set to. Conversely, the API allows the capabilities to be configured within the constraints what the device allows.
