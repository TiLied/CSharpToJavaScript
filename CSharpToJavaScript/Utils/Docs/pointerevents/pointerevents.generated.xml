<Pointers>
<summary>
Much of today&amp;apos;s web content assumes the user&amp;apos;s pointing device will be a mouse. However, since many devices support other types of pointing input devices, such as pen/stylus and touch surfaces, extensions to the existing pointing device event models are needed. <strong><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#pointer_event">Pointer events</see></strong> address that need.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch (such as one or more fingers).</para><para>The <strong><see href="https://developer.mozilla.org#pointer">pointer</see></strong> is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates. Having a single event model for pointers can simplify creating websites and applications and provide a good user experience regardless of the user's hardware. However, for scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, pointer events defines a <see cref="PointerEvent.PointerType"/> property to inspect the device type which produced the event.</para><para>The events needed to handle generic pointer input are analogous to {{domxref(&amp;quot;MouseEvent&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;mouse events&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, 1)}} (<c>mousedown</c>/<c>pointerdown</c>, <c>mousemove</c>/<c>pointermove</c>, etc.). Consequently, pointer event types are intentionally similar to mouse event types.</para><para>Additionally, a pointer event contains the usual properties present in mouse events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. In fact, the <see cref="PointerEvent"/> interface inherits all of the <see cref="MouseEvent"/> properties, thus facilitating the migration of content from mouse events to pointer events.</para>

<summary>
Pointer events extend DOM input events to support various pointing input devices such as pen/stylus and touch screens as well as mouse. The <strong>pointer</strong> is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates. Having a single event model for pointers can simplify creating websites, applications and provide a good user experience regardless of the user&amp;apos;s hardware.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Pointer events have many similarities to mouse events but they support multiple simultaneous pointers such as multiple fingers on a touch screen. This additional feature can be used to provide richer user interaction models but at the cost of additional complexity in the multi-touch interaction handling. This document demonstrates via example code, using pointer events with different multi-touch interactions.</para><para>A <strong>live</strong> version of this application is available on <see href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/pointerevents/Multi-touch_interaction.html">GitHub</see>.

<summary>
Adding <strong>gestures</strong> to an application can significantly improve the user experience. There are many types of gestures, from the simple single-touch <strong>swipe</strong> gesture to the more complex multi-touch <strong>twist</strong> gesture, where the touch points (aka <strong>pointers</strong>) move in different directions.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This example shows how to detect the <strong>pinch/zoom</strong> gesture, which uses <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">pointer events</see> to detect whether the user moves two pointers closer or farther apart from each other.</para><para>A <strong>live</strong> version of this application is available on <see href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/pointerevents/Pinch_zoom_gestures.html">GitHub</see>.

<PointersUsing_Pointer_Events>
<summary>
This guide demonstrates how to use <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">pointer events</see> and the HTML <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">canvas</see> element to build a multi-touch enabled drawing application. This example is based on the one in the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events">touch events overview</see>, except it uses the {{domxref(&amp;quot;PointerEvent&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;pointer events&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, 1)}} input event model. Another difference is that because pointer events are pointer device agnostic, the application accepts coordinate-based inputs from a mouse, a pen, or a fingertip using the same code.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>This application will only work on a browser that supports pointer events.</para>
