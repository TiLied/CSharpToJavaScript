<summary>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> The Presentation API lets a <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see> (such as a Web browser) effectively display web content through large presentation devices such as projectors and network-connected televisions. Supported types of multimedia devices include both displays which are wired using HDMI, DVI, or the like, or wireless, using <see href="https://www.dlna.org/">DLNA</see>, <see href="https://developers.google.com/cast/">Chromecast</see>, <see href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologyoverviews/streaming">AirPlay</see>, or <see href="https://www.wi-fi.org/applications">Miracast</see>.

<para><see href="https://developer.mozilla.orgpresentation_mode_illustration.png">1-UA mode loaded the Controlling and Presenting pages together before outputting to displays. 2-UA mode loaded them separately using the Presentation Control Protocol.</see></para><para>In general, a web page uses the Presentation Controller API to specify the web content to be rendered on presentation device and initiate the presentation session. With Presentation Receiver API, the presenting web content obtains the session status. With providing both the controller page and the receiver one with a messaged-based channel, a Web developer can implement the interaction between these two pages.</para><para>Depending on the connection mechanism provided by the presentation device, any controller- and receiver page can be rendered by the same user agent, or by separated user agents.</para>
<para><see href="https://mediascape.github.io/presentation-api-polyfill/">Presentation API polyfill</see> contains a JavaScript polyfill of the <see href="https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</see> specification under standardization within the <see href="https://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working Group</see> at W3C. The polyfill is mostly intended for exploring how the Presentation API may be implemented on top of different presentation mechanisms.</para>
