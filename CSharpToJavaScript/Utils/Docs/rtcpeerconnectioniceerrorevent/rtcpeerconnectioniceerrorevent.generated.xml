<value>A string which specifies the local IP address of the network<br/>connection to the ICE server with which negotiations were occurring when the error<br/>occurred. This address identifies the network interface on the local device which is<br/>being used to attempt to establish the connection to the remote peer.This can be useful on multi-homed systems—devices with more than one network<br/>connection—to determine which network interface is being used. For example, on a mobile<br/>phone, there are typically at least two network interfaces available: the cellular<br/>connection and a Wi-Fi connection.If the local IP address isn&amp;apos;t exposed as part of a local candidate, the value of<br/><c>address</c> is <c>null</c>.</value>
