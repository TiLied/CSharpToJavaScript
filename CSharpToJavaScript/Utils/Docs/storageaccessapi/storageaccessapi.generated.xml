<Storage_Access_API>
<summary>
The Storage Access API is relevant to user agents that, by default, block access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state to improve privacy (for example, to prevent tracking). There are legitimate uses for third-party cookies and unpartitioned state that we still want to enable, even with these default restrictions in place. Examples include single sign-on (SSO) with federated identity providers (IdPs), or persisting user details such as location data or viewing preferences across different sites.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The API provides methods that allow embedded resources to check whether they currently have access to third-party cookies and, if not, to request access from the user agent.</para>

The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">Storage Access API</see> can be used by embedded cross-site documents to verify whether they have access to <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies">third-party cookies</see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning#state_partitioning">unpartitioned state</see> and, if not, to request access. We&amp;apos;ll briefly look at a common storage access scenario.
