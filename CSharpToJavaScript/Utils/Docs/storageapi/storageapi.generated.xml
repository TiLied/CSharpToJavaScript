<summary>
The <see href="https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/">Storage Standard</see> defines a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user&amp;apos;s browser.

<para>The data stored for a website which is managed by the Storage Standard usually includes <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB databases</see> and <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache">Cache API data</see>, but may include other kind of site-accessible data such as <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web Storage API data</see>.</para><para>The Storage API gives websites the ability to find out how much space they can use, how much they are already using, and even control whether or not they need to be alerted before the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user agent">user agent</see> disposes of data in order to make room for other things.</para><para>This article gives an overview of the way user agents store and maintain websites&amp;apos; data.

Web developers can use a number of technologies to store data in the user&amp;apos;s browser (i.e., on the local disk of the device the user is using to view the website).

<para>The amount of data browsers allow websites to store and the mechanisms they use to delete data when that limit is reached differs between browsers.</para><para>This article describes the web technologies that can be used to store data, the quotas that browsers have in place to limit websites from storing too much data, and the mechanisms they use to delete data when needed.</para>
