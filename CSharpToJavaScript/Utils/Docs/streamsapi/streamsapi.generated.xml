<summary>
The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">Streams API</see> adds a very useful set of tools to the web platform, providing objects that allow JavaScript to programmatically access streams of data received over the network and process them as desired by the developer. Some of the concepts and terminology associated with streams might be new to you — this article explains all you need to know.

<Streams_APIUsing_readable_byte_streams>
<summary>
Readable <strong>byte streams</strong> are <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams">readable streams</see> that have an underlying byte source of <c>type: &amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;</c>, and which support efficient zero-copy transfer of data from the underlying source to a consumer (bypassing the stream&amp;apos;s internal queues).<br/>They are intended for use cases where data might be supplied or requested in arbitrary sized and potentially very large chunks, and hence where avoiding making copies is likely to improve efficiency.
