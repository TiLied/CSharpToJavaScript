<summary>
The <strong><c>WakeLockSentinel</c></strong> interface of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API">Screen Wake Lock API</see> can be used to monitor the status of the platform screen wake lock, and manually release the lock when needed.

<WakeLockSentinelRelease>
<summary>
The <strong><c>release</c></strong> event of the <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> interface is fired when the sentinel object's handle has been released.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>A <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> can be released manually via the <c>release()</c> method, or automatically via the platform wake lock.<br/>This can happen if the document becomes inactive or looses visibility, if the device is low on power or the user turns on a power save mode.</para>

<WakeLockSentinelReleased>
<summary>
The <strong><c>released</c></strong> read-only property of the <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> interface returns a boolean that indicates whether a <see cref="WakeLockSentinel"/> has been released.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The <c>WakeLockSentinel</c> is released when the associated platform screen wake lock is revoked; afterwards <c>released</c> will always return <c>true</c>.<br/>If a subsequent screen wake lock is required, the application will need to request a new screen wake lock (the current <c>WakeLockSentinel</c> cannot be reused).</para>
