<summary>
The <strong>Web Crypto API</strong> is an interface allowing a script to use cryptographic primitives in order to build systems using cryptography.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>Some browsers implemented an interface called <see cref="Crypto"/> without having it well defined or being cryptographically sound.<br/>In order to avoid confusion, methods and properties of this interface have been removed from browsers implementing the Web Crypto API, and all Web Crypto API methods are available on a new interface: <see cref="SubtleCrypto"/>.<br/>The <see cref="Crypto.Subtle"/> property gives access to an object implementing it.</para><blockquote class="WARNING"><h5>WARNING</h5><para>The Web Crypto API provides a number of low-level cryptographic primitives. It&amp;apos;s very easy to misuse them, and the pitfalls involved can be very subtle.</para><para>Even assuming you use the basic cryptographic functions correctly, secure key management and overall security system design are extremely hard to get right, and are generally the domain of specialist security experts.</para><para>Errors in security system design and implementation can make the security of the system completely ineffective.</para><para>Please learn and experiment, but don&amp;apos;t guarantee or imply the security of your work before an individual knowledgeable in this subject matter thoroughly reviews it. The <see href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101 Course</see> can be a great place to start learning about the design and implementation of secure systems.</para></blockquote>

<summary>
This article will focus on uses of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest"><c>digest</c></see> method of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto">SubtleCrypto interface</see>. A lot of other methods within the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</see> have very specific cryptographic use cases, creating hashes of content (which is what the digest method does) has lots of very useful purposes.

<remarks>
<para>This article does not discuss the cryptographic uses of the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto">SubtleCrypto interface</see>. An important thing to take away from this article is <strong>don&amp;apos;t use this API</strong> for production cryptographic purposes because it is powerful and low level. To use it correctly you will need to take many context specific steps to accomplish cryptographic tasks correctly. If any of those steps are taken incorrectly at best your code won&amp;apos;t run, at worse it <strong>will</strong> run and you will unknowingly be putting your users at risk with an insecure product.</para><para>You may not even need to use the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</see> at all. Many of the things you would want to use cryptography for are already solved and part of the Web platform. For example, if you are worried about man-in-the-middle attacks, such as Wi-Fi hotspots reading the information between the client and the server, this is solved by ensuring correct use of <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS">HTTPS</see>. Do you want to securely send information between users? Then you can set up a data connection between users using <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_data_channels">WebRTC Data Channels</see> which is encrypted as part of the standard.</para><para>The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto">SubtleCrypto interface</see> provides low level primitives for working with cryptography, but implementing a system using these tools is a complicated task. Mistakes are hard to notice and the results can mean your user&amp;apos;s data is not as secure as you think it is. Which could have catastrophic results if your users are sharing sensitive or valuable data.</para><para>If in doubt don&amp;apos;t try doing it yourself, hire someone with experience and ensure your software is audited by a security expert.</para>
