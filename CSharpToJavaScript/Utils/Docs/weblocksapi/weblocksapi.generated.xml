<summary>
The <strong>Web Locks API</strong> allows scripts running in one tab or worker to asynchronously acquire a lock, hold it while work is performed, then release it. While held, no other script executing in the same origin can acquire the same lock, which allows a web app running in multiple tabs or workers to coordinate work and the use of resources.
