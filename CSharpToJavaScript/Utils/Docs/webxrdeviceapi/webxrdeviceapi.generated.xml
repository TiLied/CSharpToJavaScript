<summary>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5> <strong>Experimental</strong></div> <strong>WebXR</strong> is a group of standards which are used together to support rendering 3D scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds (<strong>virtual reality</strong>, or <strong>VR</strong>), or for adding graphical imagery to the real world, (<strong>augmented reality</strong>, or <strong>AR</strong>). The <strong>WebXR Device API</strong> implements the core of the WebXR feature set, managing the selection of output devices, render the 3D scene to the chosen device at the appropriate frame rate, and manage motion vectors created using input controllers.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>WebXR-compatible devices include fully-immersive 3D headsets with motion and orientation tracking, eyeglasses which overlay graphics atop the real-world scene passing through the frames, and handheld mobile phones which augment reality by capturing the world with a camera and augment that scene with computer-generated imagery.</para><para>To accomplish these things, the WebXR Device API provides the following key capabilities:</para><para>At the most basic level, a scene is presented in 3D by computing the perspective to apply to the scene in order to render it from the viewpoint of each of the user&amp;apos;s eyes by computing the position of each eye and rendering the scene from that position, looking in the direction the user is currently facing. Each of these two images is rendered into a single framebuffer, with the left eye&amp;apos;s rendered image on the left and the right eye&amp;apos;s viewpoint rendered into the right half of the buffer. Once both eyes&amp;apos; perspectives on the scene have been rendered, the resulting framebuffer is delivered to the WebXR device to be presented to the user through their headset or other appropriate display device.</para><para>While the older <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API">WebVR API</see> was designed solely to support Virtual Reality (VR), WebXR provides support for both VR and Augmented Reality (AR) on the web. Support for AR functionality is added by the WebXR Augmented Reality Module.</para><para>A typical XR device can have either 3 or 6 degrees of freedom and might or might not have an external positional sensor.</para><para>The equipment may also include an accelerometer, barometer, or other sensors which are used to sense when the user moves through space, rotates their head, or the like.</para>

<WebXR_Device_APIBounded_reference_spaces>
<summary>
Among the various reference spaces available in the WebXR set of APIs, the <strong><c>bounded-floor</c></strong><strong> reference space</strong> is somewhat unique. Not only is it represented by a unique subclass, <see cref="XRBoundedReferenceSpace"/>, but it's the only one which restricts movement based not upon virtual restrictions but upon limitations imposed by the real world. This article examines bounded reference spaces as represented by <c>XRBoundedReferenceSpace</c>, describing what they are and how they&amp;apos;re used.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>There are many uses for bounded reference spaces, including projects such as virtual paint studios or 3D construction, modeling, or sculpting systems; training simulations or lesson scenarios; dance or other performance-based games; or the preview of 3D objects in the real world using augmented reality.</para>

The first and most important thing to understand when considering the code to manage point-of-view and cameras in your application is this: <strong>WebXR does not have cameras</strong>. There&amp;apos;s no magic object provided by either the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</see> or the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR</see> API that represents the viewer that you can rotate and move around to automatically change what&amp;apos;s seen on the screen. In this guide we show how use <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</see> to simulate camera movements without having a camera to move. These techniques can be used in any WebGL (or WebXR) project.

WebXR, with the <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR Device API</see> at its core, provides the functionality needed to bring both augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) to the web. Together, these technologies are referred to as <strong>mixed reality (MR)</strong> or <strong>cross reality (XR)</strong>. Mixed reality is a large and complex subject, with much to learn and many other APIs to bring together to create an engaging experience for users.

At a fundamental level, rendering of scenes for <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API">WebXR</see> presentation in either augmented reality or virtual reality contexts is performed using <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</see>, so the two APIs share much of the same design language. However, in order to provide the ability to present scenes in true 3D using XR headsets and other such equipment, WebXR has additional concepts that must be understood.
</summary>

The WebXR APIs used for implementing augmented and virtual reality is designed specifically to provide the ability to insert a human into a virtual environment. To accomplish this, software needs the ability to not only track the locations, orientation, and movements of objects in the virtual world, but the user&amp;apos;s location, orientation, and movement as well. But WebXR goes beyond that by adding the ability to track the location, orientation, and motion of the input devices which generate data used to determine the position and movement of individual parts of the viewer&amp;apos;s body (with appropriate equipment).

Assuming you&amp;apos;re already familiar with 3D graphics in general and WebGL in particular, taking that next bold step into mixed reality—the idea of presenting artificial scenery or objects in addition to or in place of the real world—is not overly complicated. Before you can begin to render your augmented or virtual reality scenario, you need to create and set up the WebXR session, and you should know how to shut it down properly as well.
