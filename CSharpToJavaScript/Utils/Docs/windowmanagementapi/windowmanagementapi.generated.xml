<summary>
The <see href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Management_API">Window Management API</see> introduces the concept of the <strong>multi-screen origin</strong> — this is the (0,0) coordinate of the host operating system (OS)&amp;apos;s virtual screen arrangement, around which all available screens and windows are positioned. The multi-screen origin is the top-left corner of the OS primary screen by convention, although the spec stipulates that it could be any arbitrary point within the virtual screen arrangement.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>The primary screen can usually be specified by the user via OS settings, and generally contains OS UI features such as the taskbar/icon dock.</para><blockquote class="NOTE"><h5>NOTE</h5><para>Positive coordinate values are to the right and downwards on the screen arrangement, while negative ones are to the left and upwards.</para></blockquote>
